*Non-technical post* -- Hey, we have a new logo!

# First, what is a "drogue"?

The word "drogue" has several meanings. 
It's French for "drug" which is probably not the best connotation.
The flunkies in _A Clockwork Orange_ were called "droogs" which is also not great.

But there's also a [*storm drogue*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogue) which is used to add stability to vessels in the sea.

# Who is Rodney?

Rodney is a garden gnome my niece left in our yard a few years ago. 
He's adorable and keeps watch over the chickens and the other goings-on in the yard.

His hat seems rather *storm drogue*-shaped. 

# And the new identity

For projects, I have started to prefer logos that are actually mascots. 
They just seem more personable.

Thanks to our handy-dandy designer [James Cobb](https://twitter.com/insectengine), we
now have a logo-fied version of Rodney the gnome:

He's happy, friendly, and will help add stability to your IoT vessels, we hope.
