might have noticed, we talk about Rust a lot. Mostly in the context of embedded programming. However, we also\nhave a few bits and pieces in the cloud side of things. If you have\na device that gathers data, you might want to send that data somewhere for further processing and storage. Now, if we\nare using Rust to implement the embedded side, why not use it on the backend as well?\nSure, why not?\nThat is mostly how it started. You have a new programming language, you learned a few new tricks, and you really like\nhow it works. So when it came to start some backend development, why not simply try Rust and see where that leads.\nWorst case, you learned a bit more about Rust in general.\nMy personal background is Java, and before that C and C++. Using C/C++ you are really in control of performance and\nresource consumption. However, that comes with a downside, called \"undefined behavior\" (actually it comes with a bunch\nof downsides). In a nutshell: your application is fast and efficient, but crashes every now and then, due to a memory\ncorruption you don't know the origin of. Java on the other hand doesn't suffer from that problem, but the Java\nvirtual machine and its garbage collector consume their share of resources.\nWhen it comes to C/C++ vs Java, you trade software engineering time vs compute resources. Writing C/C++ takes\nas lot more time, but yields (in most cases) more efficient applications. Writing Java code takes less time, but\nconsumes more compute resources when running. The story is similar with other languages like Python, Go, or .NET,\nwhenever a VM or garbage collector comes into play.\nSo let's see what Rust brings us in the context of frontend and backend. I will not write too much about he\nembedded side here, as I think we have good posts covering that topic already.\nThe backend\nBackend application are mostly \"classic\", non-UI applications. The Rust ecosystem has a stockpile of libraries\navailable to help you implement a server side, networking application. This is also where the async/await keyword\nand functionality of Rust comes in handy. So many operations in the backend are of the pattern: wait for request, evaluate,\nsend request, wait for the outcome, respond to original request.\nAsynchronous &amp; efficiency\nIf you did this all synchronously, waiting for every step, you will have a lot of blocked threads, wasting resources.\nThat is why on the Java side, frameworks like Eclipse Vert.x are so popular now. However,\nasynchronous Java still feels a bit strange:\nprivate void handleAddCuteName(RoutingContext rc) {\n  HttpServerResponse response = rc.response();\n  JsonObject bodyAsJson = rc.getBodyAsJson();\n  if (bodyAsJson != null &amp;&amp; bodyAsJson.containsKey(\"name\")) {\n    String id = id();\n    defaultCache.putAsync(bodyAsJson, bodyAsJson.getString(\"name\"))\n      .thenAccept(s -&gt; {\n        response\n          .setStatusCode(201)\n          .end(\"Cute name added\");\n      });\n  } else {\n    response\n      .setStatusCode(400)\n      .end(String.format(\"Body is %s. 'id' and 'name' should be provided\", bodyAsJson));\n  }\n}\n\nYes, that is due to the fact that Java doesn't see asynchronous programming as concept of the language. It was added\n\"on top\" at a later time. And that example is actually rather simple. These nested structures can get out of hand\npretty quickly, and make your code hard to understand, and with that it makes it hard to find bugs.\nA more understandable way of coding Java is this:\n@Path(\"/country\")\npublic class CountriesResource {\n\n    @Inject @RestClient\n    CountriesService countriesService;\n\n    @GET @Path(\"/name/{name}\")\n    public Set&lt;Country&gt; name(@PathParam String name) {\n        return countriesService.getByName(name);\n    }\n}\n\nWhile it is easier to read and understand, it has some downsides: First of all, it is blocking code. A call to name\nwill only return once the call to the service has returned. Second, annotations and injection are runtime concepts.\nThat means, that it is processed while the application is running. Although that setup may never change after\nthe program was compiled, it still consumes resources during runtime. True, Quarkus\ndoes a great job, reducing that overhead, but not fully.\nNow lets take a look at a possible Rust variant of that, for example using Actix:\n#[get(\"/\")]\nasync fn index(client: web::Data&lt;Client&gt;) -&gt; HttpResponse {\n    let result = client.get_result().await?;\n    HttpResponse::Ok().json(result)\n}\n\nThat is easy to understand and if you would drill down into the implementation, you would also see that it is quite\nefficient. The #[get] attribute (annotation) is actually processed during compile time, creating code on the fly\nto wire this up. Alongside that, the async/await keywords\nhelp you write code in a way that the developer can understand, yet the compiler can optimize into an asynchronous\nexecution flow.\nStaying safe\nAll of that asynchronism is great, but feels a bit dangerous, when you come from a Java or C/C++ world. Multiple threads,\npassing along of data structures and states, all in a network application context. Don't forget that Rust has all\nkinds of features to help out, tracking ownership of data\nand ensuring that data can safely be shared in a concurrent environment.\nYou get the best of both worlds.\nThe frontend\nHaving a backend API is great, but as important as that is a decent web UI. Sometimes you just want to push a few\nbuttons and don't want to craft up the required curl command for the server to accept your request.\nWhat was and might be\nPersonally I am allergic to JavaScript. HTML and CSS is ok, but\nI never could learn to live with the quirks and pitfalls of JavaScript. While you have lots of alternatives outside the\nbrowser, inside you just had to use it.\nYes, had! Now we have a thing called WASM.\nJust putting aside all my dislike for JavaScript for the moment,\nhere is a good reason for considering WASM. I would recommend watching the full\ntalk. Additionally to the other benefits of Rust, switching to WASM improved the performance over 3 times.\nRust and WASM\nRust has great support for WASM. Not only the compiler, or a set of libraries, which interface with the browser APIs.\nUsing the Yew project, you can create complete front-end web applications, like ReactJS.\nYew itself doesn't provide you any components out of the box, but there is for example, a project\ncalled ybc, which allows you to use Bulma (a project similar to boostrap) as part of Yew.\nWhile Bulma is a great framework, PatternFly seems to be a better fit for a more dashboardy,\nconsole-ish web application like ours. So here you go: PatternFly for Yew. \nAll shiny?\nNot everything. Actix had a few troubles in the past with their community. The recent upgrade of Tokio to version 1\n(which is a breaking change) might cause some ripples in your dependency tree. Some libraries exist in Java that you\nmiss in Rust. Then again, nothing that other ecosystems don't see as well.\nAlso does the typical experience of Rust prevail in frontend, backend, and embedded: you need to sit down with your\ncompiler and have a decent review of your code. In the end the compiler will convince you that your code is full of bugs,\nyou come back with a better version. Once it compiles, it runs! That process, of finding bugs/issues early in the process,\nmight cause some frustration.\nWhat are the benefits\nThere is a lot of good stuff that comes out of it though.\nSane frontends\nFirst of all, JavaScript is mostly gone. All the features like type safety, ownership, exhaustive match patterns, are\nfinally available in the frontend as well. Just as an example, the following code is from our console. We have some\napp page routing, using an enum, and some code to render the main content, using the router switch:\n\npub enum AppRoute {\n    #[to = \"/spy\"]\n    Spy,\n    #[to = \"/examples\"]\n    Examples,\n    #[to = \"/\"]\n    Index,\n}\n\nfn content() -&gt; Html {\n    html!{\n        &lt;Router&lt;AppRoute, ()&gt;\n            redirect = Router::redirect(|_|AppRoute::Index)\n            render = Router::render(|switch: AppRoute| {\n                match switch {\n                    AppRoute::Spy =&gt; html!{&lt;Spy/&gt;},\n                    AppRoute::Index =&gt; html!{&lt;Index/&gt;},\n                    AppRoute::Examples =&gt; html!{&lt;Examples/&gt;},\n                }\n            })\n        /&gt;\n    }\n}\n\nAdding a new variant to the enum, will automatically trigger a compiler error, since the match in the router is\nno longer exhaustive. You simply can't forget to handle it.\nDifferent worlds, same language\nNo matter if you are programming embedded, backend, or frontend, you always use the same language. Not only can you\nre-use your knowledge about the programming language, but also data structures and even logic. Test and document it\nin the same way.\nI mentioned earlier that inside the browser you only had JavaScript as an option. Not entirely true. We also had Java\nand .NET applets, and there was Flash. The same for the embedded side: there was JavaME for microcontrollers, there\nstill is Micropython and a few others.\nHowever, with Rust, you now have the ability to really use the same technology in all three areas. Not just as \"plug-in\",\nlike Java applets, or a VM like Micropython. It doesn't require a garbage collector on an embedded device, and can\neven revert to static memory allocation, if you wish to do that. None of the other languages is able to achieve that.\nNone? Really?\nTrue, C and C++ can run on frontend, backend,\nand embedded as well. Achieving similar performance, while not requiring garbage collection.\nHowever, coming back to the original problem, writing working/bug-free C/C++ code is much more time-consuming than writing\nthe same code in Rust. Rust prevents you from many programming errors already during compile time. That benefit\nin development speed, also results in more functionality being created. People can solve more issues in their time,\nwhich automatically results in more open source dependencies you can leverage for your own project.\nAlso, did you try out cargo embed? Within a few minutes you are up and running, flashing your device. Setting up a\ncomplete C/C++ toolchain for embedded devices takes way longer. Even when using projects like Platform.io or Arduino.\nWhich means that you can also re-use the same dependency manager and build tool for all of your projects.\nConclusion\nI am pretty sure that we wouldn't have achieved that much in our time if we had worked with C/C++ on the backend and\nfrontend side. Using JavaScript on the frontend, allergies aside, would have required to use three different\nlanguages and ecosystems.\nUsing Java would have been an option, but I will leave you with a screenshot of my cluster, running Drogue IoT cloud.\nYou will see the pods, sorted by memory consumption. Try to figure out which processes are written in Rust, in Go, or\nin Java.\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/all-things-rust/","title":"All things Rust: Frontend, Backend, Embedded"},"https://blog.drogue.io/bluetooth-mesh/":{"body":"Bluetooth Mesh is a brokerless system for devices to communicate within\na local area. We've implemented a Bluetooth Mesh stack, in Rust, on top\nof Drogue-Device, our async framework for embedded development.\nWhat's Bluetooth Mesh?\nBluetooth Mesh is a mesh topology using connectionless BLE advertising packets, to allow\na variety of devices to communicate with each other, using a low-power means, without\nnecessarily having knowledge about other members of the mesh.\nThe part that makes a mesh is the fact it uses \"managed flooding\" to relay\npackets possibly beyond the distance a single radio can transmit. Bluetooth,\nas we know, has a somewhat limited range. Each member of the Mesh then, can\noptionally extend the physical range of the entire mesh, by repeating or relaying\nmessages onward.\nThe \"managed flooding\" aspect means that every node capable of relaying does\nattempt to relay any message it sees for the first time. Each message traversing\nthe mesh starts with a TTL (time-to-live) that is decremented each time a node\nrelays it onwards. In this way, hopefully every node sees every message at least\nonce, while also not repeatedly relaying messages it's seen more than once.\nWhy Bluetooth Mesh and not Zigbee, Thread or something else?\nWe don't view the question of radio technology as an XOR condition. \nInstead, we are simply starting with Bluetooth Mesh because we already\nhave familiarity with it, and the Bluetooth Consortium is pretty good about\nmaking its specifications openly available.\nWe did want a low-power method of connecting hundreds of battery-powered\ndevices, so WiFi is excluded from the potential candidates.\nThe Moving Parts of a Mesh\nDevices, Elements &amp; Models.\nEvery participant in the mesh is a device (or node).  A device is a physical\nthing, such as a lightswitch, an mains power outlet, or an internet-connected chicken.\nEvery device has one or more elements, which represent an individually-addressable portion\nof the device. A 2-gang outlet would have two elements: one element for the left socket, one\nelement for the right socket.\nEach element may have one or more models associated with it.  A model in the Mesh\nworld is a predefined idea of a thing that can control or be controlled. There are models\ndefined for on-off switches and things that can be turned on and off. \nEach model is identified by either a specification-defined UUID or a vendor-defined UUID.\nModels allow data to be smaller over the air, and for all participants to know how to react\nto messages, since they all share the same idea of what's being talked about. Bluetooth Mesh\nmessages are not self-describing. By using pre-defined models, a 4-byte message can be transmitted,\nand all relevant devices know how to interpret those 4 bytes within the context of the\nknown model structure.\nAddresses\nUnicast addresses\nEvery element gets assigned a unique unicast address within the mesh. Given this, a\nsingle device with multiple elements ends up with multiple unicast addresses.  Using\nthe unicast address, messages can be targetting directly to an element on a device.\nAny node that receives messages for another's address will still relay those messages\nonwards, helping them to find their destination.\nVirtual addresses\nBluetooth Mesh also defines a capability of having virtual addresses which are not assigned\nto any particular node. Instead, they act similar to IP mcast groups, which devices can send messages \nto, or monitor for messages being sent to it.\nVirtual addresses are the part that allow devices to work in a publish/subscribe model without\nany central broker.\nKeys\nDevice Key\nEvery device has its own cryptographic key used during provisioning to create a device\nkey known by the provisioner (see below). For messages destined directly to the device for configuring\nit by the provisioner, this device key is used to communicate securely.\nNetwork Keys\nEvery device brought into a mesh is given the network key used by the mesh. This allows multiple\ndistinct meshes to operate within radio earshot of each other, and not intermingle.\nDevices on a mesh can also be added to a subnet of the mesh, with its own unique key, to further\nrestrict which devices can see which messages.\nApplication Keys\nA mesh may have one or more application keys. Each element/model on a device can use an appropriate\napplication key, to even further restrict which devices can see which messages.\nApplication keys provide a way to cryptographically keep your untrusted internet-connected chicken device from\nsecretly unlocking your mesh-enabled doorlock. \nProvisioner\nA provisioner is a node that controls the membership and logical topology of the mesh. The\nmesh does not require a provisioner during normal operation. A provisioner is only required\nto bring a new device into the mesh and to configure the topology through setting up the\nvarious publish and subscribe rules for each device.\nA stable mesh network can live happily without a provisioner, once established.\nBluetooth Mesh on Linux is... challenging.\nYour run of the mill Linux distribution probably includes bluez, which has out-of-the-box\nsupport for Bluetooth Mesh. Sorta. Kinda.\nAlas, the default bluez bluetoothd only supports Bluetooth Mesh over the GATT bearer,\nwhich really isn't the ideal way to go about it. The GATT bearer uses connection-oriented\ncommunications between the provisioner and the device being configured. It doesn't use the\nnormal underlying advertising-based bearer used by the devices to communicate with each other.\nFirst you have to stop bluetoothd on your linux node then install \nthe bluez-mesh package on fedora, or bluez-meshd on debian/ubuntu.\nThe bluetooth-meshd tool can speak native advertising-bearer Bluetooth Mesh.\nYou can run the ble mesh in a separate terminal: sudo /usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetooth-meshd. \nInstead of using meshctl, you then use mesh-cfgclient to provision nodes.\nLet's walk through an example.\nFlash your device\nOur example uses the current nRF52840-dk example that sets up a board with one active\nbutton and one active LED.  Instructions for loading the code onto the board are \nincluded in the repository.\nDiscover unprovisioned devices\nOnce you have your linux stack working, you can listen for devices telling the world\nthey are unprovisioned, or not a part of any mesh network. As it learns from unprovisioned\ndevices, it'll display it on the console.\nmesh-cfgclient\n[mesh-cfgclient]# discover-unprovisioned on\nUnprovisioned scan started\nScan result:\n\trssi = -39\n\tUUID = 0EF817B94FA04859A4F7C80312CD724E\n\tOOB = A040\n\nProvision it\nOnce you have the UUID of the device wanting to join the mesh, you can provision it.\n[mesh-cfgclient]# provision 0EF817B94FA04859A4F7C80312CD724E\nProvisioning started\nAssign addresses for 1 elements\nProvisioning done:\nMesh node:\n\tUUID = 0EF817B94FA04859A4F7C80312CD724E\n\tprimary = 00c4\n\n\telements (1):\n\nWhen this is completed, the current state of affairs is:\n\nThe device has the network key\nThe provisioner assigned it a unicast address\nThe provisioner knows the device's key\n\nInspect it\nFurther commands happen from the config menu, which you enter by typing menu config.\nNext, type target 00c4 (or the address assigned for your node), so that subsequent commands\nare sent, using the device's key, to the device.\nThe composition-get command will retrieve the device's composition of elements and models.\n[config: Target = 00c4]# composition-get\nReceived DeviceCompositionStatus (len 21)\nReceived composion:\n\tFeature support:\n\t\trelay: yes\n\t\tproxy: no\n\t\tfriend: no\n\t\tlpn: no\n\t Element 0:\n\t\tlocation: 0100\n\t\tSIG defined models:\n\t\t  Model ID\t0000 \"Configuration Server\"\n\t\t  Model ID\t1001 \"Generic OnOff Client\"\n\t\t  Model ID\t1000 \"Generic OnOff Server\"\n\nIn this case, we see that this particular device does indeed support relaying. It also has\none element, which includes the Configuration Server model, which is the exact model that\ncan reply to commands such as composition-get.\nIt also includes the Generic OnOff Client, which in our case the button1 on our board.\nAdditionally it includes the Generic OnOff Server which is connected to the LED on this board.\nNaming within the Bluetooth Mesh specification can sometimes be ambiguously confusing.\nA client tends to be a model that sends commands, while a server is a model that receives them.\nGenerally speaking. Sometimes. Mostly. Kinda.\nAt this point, nothing happens on the board.\nDistribute Application Key\nBefore we can make the button or LED do something useful, we need to create an application key.\nWe have to go back in mesh-cfgclient and create an application key for the primary network.\nWe have to provide an index, which gives everyone on the mesh a short name to refer to that\nspecific key. \nIndexes do not have to be sequential. In this case, we have app-keys in indexes 0, 1 and 2, but we\njump up and create an app-key in index 4.\n[config: Target = 00c4]# back\n[config: Target = 00c4]# appkey-create 0 4\n[config: Target = 00c4]# keys\nNetKey: 0 (0x000), phase: 0\n\tapp_keys = 0 (0x000), 1 (0x001), 2 (0x002), 4 (0x004)\n\nCurrently, only the provisioner knows this key.  Now we must give it to the device we want\nto have it using the appkey-add command.\n[config: Target = 00c4]# appkey-add 4\nNo response for \"AppKeyAdd\" from 00c4\nReceived AppKeyStatus (len 4)\nNode 00c4 AppKey status Success\nNetKey\t0 (0x000)\nAppKey\t4 (0x004)\nReceived AppKeyStatus (len 4)\n\nYou may notice that mesh-cfgclient first reported \"No response\" but the we get a response.\nThat's life on a mesh for you.  Since Bluetooth Mesh is connectionless, a lot of timeouts\nare involved. mesh-cfgclient decided the command had timed out, but then device sent\na response a few milliseconds later and everything is fine.\nAt this point, the device has application key #4, but has no idea what to do with it.\nBind Application Key\nApplication keys can be bound to a model within an element. This tells the device that\nfor messages to or from that model within the element, it should use a specific key for\ncrypto.\nHere we bind it to both the client and the server on the board.\n[config: Target = 00c4]# bind 00c4 4 1001\nReceived ModelAppStatus (len 7)\nNode 00c4: Model App status Success\nElement Addr\t00c4\nModel ID\t1001 \"Generic OnOff Client\"\nAppIdx\t\t4 (0x004)\n\n[config: Target = 00c4]# bind 00c4 4 1000\nReceived ModelAppStatus (len 7)\nNode 00c4: Model App status Success\nElement Addr\t00c4\nModel ID\t1000 \"Generic OnOff Server\"\nAppIdx\t\t4 (0x004)\n [config: Target = 00c4]#\n\nPub and Sub\nThus far, the client and the server know how to encrypt and decrypt messages related\nto their models using application key #4. But how do they know where to send messages or receive them?\nThey don't. Yet.\nVirtual Address\nSince we don't want to bind this particular button to that particular LED, we want to use a\nvirtual address.  This will allow us to have tons of buttons turning tons of LEDs on and off, if we\nwanted. \nImagine a 3-way lightswitch. You may a switch at the top of your stairs, and another at the bottom.\nEither switch can turn the several lights going up the stairwell on or off.  Here, a virtual address\nmight represent \"control of the stairway lighting\".\nWithin mesh-cfgclient we use virt-add which synthesizes a new virtual address for us and registers\nit within the provsioner.\n[config: Target = 00c4]# virt-add\n\tVirtual addr: bda5, label: 1d3ffe292725f6cb64eaed53dba1d979\n\nStill, nobody knows about it, beside the provisioner.\nPublishing\nNow, we tell the button on the board to publish its messages to that virtual address:\n[config: Target = 00c4]# pub-set 00c4 bda5 4 1 1 1001\nNo response for \"ModelPubVirtualSet\" from 00c4\nNode 00c4 Publication status Success\nModel ID\t1001 \"Generic OnOff Client\"\n\tElement: 00c4\n\tPub Addr: bda5\n\tModel: 1001\n\tApp Key Idx: 4 (0x004)\n\tTTL: ff\nPeriod\t\t100 ms\nRexmit count\t1\nRexmit steps\t0\n\nNow, when we push or release the button, it'll be shooting messages onto the Mesh addressed to\nbda5.\nBut if a message falls in a forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it turn a light on?\nNo.\nSubscribing\nNext, we have to tell our LED to listen for messages sent to the same virtual address.\n[config: Target = 00c4]# sub-add 00c4 bda5 1000\nReceived ModelSubStatus (len 7)\n\nNode 00c4 Subscription status Success\nElement Addr\t00c4\nModel ID\t1000 \"Generic OnOff Server\"\nSubscr Addr\tbda5\n\nSuccess!\nHere, I've done the above process with two boards, so that we can see how a virtual address\nallows communication between several devices that have no knowledge of each other.\n\n  \nFirmware\nFor the most part, the firmware only has to adapt Drogue-Device actor messages to/from \ndomain-specific types, such as LEDMessage::On or ButtonMessage::Pressed to \nBluetooth Mesh model messages, such as GenericOnOffMessage::Set(...).\nThe full example code is in our repository.\nThat seems complex...\nYes, we all agree the various commands and workflow to accomplish this through\nmesh-cfgclient is complex. Ultimately mesh-cfgclient is not a super-friendly\napplication meant for end-users. Instead, it's the barest plumbing possible to\naccomplish all the steps required to provision and configure devices.\nWe assume in a real-world scenario, someone would create enough porcelain\naround it all to allow an end-user to think more semantically about lightswitches,\nstairways and internet-connected chickens.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/bluetooth-mesh/","title":"Bluetooth Mesh"},"https://blog.drogue.io/coming-up-gsoc-2021/":{"body":"Good news, everyone! Google Summer of Code 2021 is coming up. This gives you\nthe chance to throw yourself at some horrifying tech problems, learn some new skills, and maybe get to know a few more\nmemes. We are participating, how about you?\nGoogle Summer of Code (GSoC) in general\nIf you are a student wishing to participate and want to learn about GSoC in general, I recommend reading through\nthe getting started section. This should give you an overview\nof the program, and a few pointers to find more information.\nWriting a project proposal\nDrogue IoT plans to participate as part of the JBoss Community organization. In GSoC students\nneed to submit a project proposal, and need to find at least one person supporting the proposal, by agreeing to mentor.\nHow to write a good proposal is already covered by the GSoC homepage, so I don't want to into too much detail here.\nYou will also find some guides on the internet.\nIn any case, it is up to you to write a motivating project proposal, and convince someone to accept to mentor. Sounds\na bit harsh? Maybe. However, space and time is limited in GSoC and not all proposals can be accepted. Some students\nbring really great project proposals to the table, making possible mentors super excited to get started. So the more\nconvincing your proposal is, the better your chances are to get your own proposal accepted. \nGetting ideas for a proposal\nMentors are here to help, even before GSoC officially starts. It is in our own best interest to help you write a great\nproposal, to convince others that this is a great idea to invest time in.\nTo get you started, the JBoss Community, like all other organizations, compiles a list of possible project ideas.\nYou may check this list right now, but the sure to check back later, as new ideas might get added over time. Each\nproposal should also give you an idea how to get in contact with the community, whom to ask for help and what is expected\nfrom you.\nYou might notice, not all ideas are for the Drogue IoT project. Be sure to check out the other proposal as well. They\nmay offer other problems to solve, work in other areas, and work with different programming languages. Pick what\nyou prefer.\nWhat Drogue IoT is looking for\nFor Drogue IoT, we have some proposals around the creation of a protocol implementation (MQTT, CoAP, …). Both on the\nembedded side or the backend (cloud) side. Those assignments will give you the opportunity to work with the\nawesome Rust language.\nDon't be scared, we are not looking for Rust experts! Getting to start with Rust can be part of the assignment.\nWe also have one project which is more related to machine learning, creating a custom wake-word detection model for\na smart assistant: \"Hey Rodney, ...\"\nOf course, you can also bring your own ideas. These are only ideas to get you started.\nCan you re-use existing solutions?\nOpen Source is all about sharing and re-using code. You are encouraged to re-use existing open source\nimplementations. There is no need to re-write everything from scratch. Maybe your project is more about integrating\nan existing implementation, rather than creating something completely new.\nIf you do re-use code, we need to discuss this upfront. Make this part of the proposal and ensure that things\nlike \"license compatibility\" are not a blocker.\nWhat to do next?\nIn general, my recommendation is to reach out early. Before you do, do your homework! Understand what the project\nproposal is about, and what the open source project does in general. Maybe check out the source code repositories or\ntake a look at the application/the project itself. Double-check with your skill set, which mentioned skills and\ntechnologies do you already master? And, maybe already get an idea on how to solve the issue at hand.\nDiscuss ideas, propose new ones. Draft a proposal, share it with possible mentors, ask for feedback. Make mentors\ninterested in your proposal, and work with us towards a finished proposal. The earlier you start, the better for you.\nWhen the deadline for submitting your project approaches, and you are all set already, that is quite relaxing.\nSubmitting a new proposal a few hours before the deadline, how awesome it might be, has fewer chances of getting\naccepted. \nShow your skills. I know this can be hard, especially if this is your first time participating in GSoC, and you might not\nhave contributed to an open source project so far. That is ok, don't worry. Some mentors may give you a small assignment\nupfront, just to check your Git skills 😉. Of course, you can try to find something on your own to fix, and start working on\na small pull-request with the help of the community. Fixing a small issue in one project, might already be a good reference\nin another project.\nGot questions? Need help?\nPlease reach out to us, if you need any help. You can comment on the blog right here, or reach out to us\non the chat. If you prefer to directly contact us, e-mail works fine\nas well.\nLet us know how we can help.

IoT is all about sensing the physical world and controlling it\nusing our devices and backend solutions. So our devices are behaving both as sensors, generating telemetry data for cloud to consume and actuators,\ncontrolling the environment by processing commands (usually sent by the cloud solution). \nEven if these two communication patterns look similar at the first glance, there are some big differences between them.\nTelemetry data are usually large in volume and they can be considered as a single event stream. In other words, we are not interested in consuming data of a single \ndevice. That is why telemetry use case is a perfect fit for the Knative eventing as we can collect data from all our devices using different endpoints (and multiple instances of endpoints) and put them into the single channel (backed by Kafka topic). Our cloud services will then consume all these data and send them for further processing.\nCommands on the other hand are much smaller in volume, making them easier to handle. But at the same time commands are very targeted, as we're sending a command to a \nparticular device to perform a certain action. In order to do so, the command needs to be consumed only by that one device (out of millions of other devices). To complicate things further, these devices are connected through different endpoints and can be even offline. We also need to think about different delivery guarantees and command acknowledgments as we will discuss a bit later.\nImplementation\nHaving all this in mind, let's try to implement commands with our serverless IoT stack.\n\nFirst of all we need a new service that will be used as an API by IoT applications to send commands. Let's call it command endpoint. As with the telemetry case, this endpoint will transform POST payloads to cloud events and send all commands to the dedicated Kafka channel.\nNow let's consider the scenario from the diagram, where devices are connected to different \"device endpoints\" (and different instances of those endpoints). \nIn the current scenario, as we don't know where the device might be connected (if at all), all our endpoints need to subscribe to the channel and receive every command. Then, based on their internal state they can deliver the command to the appropriate device or drop it if the device is not connected to them. \nThis is a bit suboptimal as only one endpoint will actually deliver the message and everyone else will discard it. But remember, commands are low-volume traffic so even this solution can scale to a large number of devices (and endpoints). And of course, this is just first implementation and we can improve on top of this design in the future.\nExamples\nSo, how does all this look in practice? When you get the status of the Drogue cloud now, with\n./hack/status.sh\n\nYou'll see a new section with all important information about commands\nSend commands to the device\n---------------------------\n\nAfter you created a device, try these commands at a shell prompt:\n\nPublish data from the device and specify how long will you wait for a command with 'ttd' parameter (in seconds)\n\n  http --auth device_id:foobar POST http://http-endpoint.drogue-iot.10.101.208.153.nip.io/publish/device_id/foo?ttd=30 temp:=42\n\nOr subscribe with the MQTT device\n\n  mqtt sub -v -h 192.168.64.28.nip.io -p 30880 -u device_id -pw foobar -i device_id -s --cafile tls.crt -t cmd -V 3\n\nSend command to that device from another terminal window:\n\n http POST http://command-endpoint.drogue-iot.10.101.208.153.nip.io/command/device_id/foo set-temp:=40\n\nHere, you can see how to subscribe to receive commands from your devices and also how to send commands to them by simply POSTing to the appropriate command endpoint URL.\nInteresting thing to discuss here is the ttd parameter, which is needed in order to receive a command for a device using HTTP protocol. This is because, unlike MQTT, HTTP is not connection oriented protocol. Meaning that device will not keep a permanent connection to the cloud on which it can receive commands as they come. Specifying TTD (Time till disconnect) while sending telemetry will make the client wait for the specified number of seconds (30 in the example above) for the cloud to send a command. This will usually trigger a backend solution (a digital twin for example) to send a command to the device while it's connected.\n$ http --auth device_id:foobar POST http://http-endpoint.drogue-iot.10.101.208.153.nip.io/publish/device_id/foo?ttd=30 temp:=42\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\ndate: Thu, 21 Jan 2021 12:05:15 GMT\nserver: envoy\ntransfer-encoding: chunked\nx-envoy-upstream-service-time: 3140\n\n{\"set-temp\": 40}\n\nOn the other hand, devices connecting using MQTT have a much simpler task.

You just sent your first commands to your devices.\nFuture\nWe made our first foray into sending commands to devices using serverless infrastructure. But this is just a tip of the iceberg. Let's now discuss what the future holds\nand what we need to do to make all this production ready.\nSecurity\nFirst of all, we need to sort the security of the command endpoint (and cloud services in general) as we want to make sure that only appropriate applications\ncan receive telemetry and send commands to our devices.\nQuality of service\nAs it's implemented at the moment, commands are sent in the \"fire and forget\" manner. The application have no confirmation if the command was delivered, let alone \nexecuted by the device. This kind of commands are useful in some scenarios and much easier to implement (that's why we started there), but often you want a confirmation\nwhether the command is actually executed or not. For example, if you send a command to close the door you want to be sure that the door is closed as a result (or know that the command has failed). This kind of request-reply pattern requires some more design and implementation considerations (especially over the eventing infrastructure), but it's definitely a required feature and something we need to provide.\nCommand buffering\nGenerally storing/queueing commands for million of devices is not advisable. Consider queueing commands for a device that has been offline for a long time. What's the \"time to live\" for those commands? Are subsequent commands executed in order? What's the state of the device after executing all previously queued commands?\nThe usual approach here is to use a digital twin to set the desired state for the device. The twin then should try to reconcile that state with the physical device, by repeatedly sending commands with the latest state until it succeeds. But for this we need an immediate result of command execution. You should think of delivering commands more in the terms of Kubernetes reconciliation loops rather than queuing systems.\nHowever, some IoT platforms allow temporary buffering of commands for offline devices. We have to find a way to support it in a similar fashion so we can integrate with them.\nFilter\nAs we've seen previously, at the moment all our device endpoints receive all the commands and then most of them are discarded. There's a lot of room for improvement there\nand already proven patterns for solving these kind of use cases, so stay tuned for future improvements.\nMore protocols\nSo far we only covered HTTP (in a so called \"long polling\" fashion) and MQTT, which are the most common protocols used for IoT today. But there's a room for a lot more of them. Opening the system for web socket connections, gRPC, AMQP, Kafka, etc. would help grow the ecosystem substantially.\nCloud events specification\nAs with the telemetry, the system uses cloud events as an internal events format. We should strive to create a common specification for the event format in this case as that could foster more integration options in the future.\nAs you can see, we are just scratching the tip of the iceberg here. There will be a lot of good stuff coming in this area. So keep an eye on this space and join us in developing it if that's what interests you.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/command-your-devices/","title":"Command your devices"},"https://blog.drogue.io/consume-drogue-messages/":{"body":"For most IoT developers, drogue-cloud is designed to be used \"as a\nservice\". But if you have admin access to the cluster on which\ndrogue-cloud is running, i.e. you installed it yourself on minikube\nor kind, it's possible to \"extend\" the platform by triggering a\nfunction each time an event from a device is processed.\n\nThis article assumes you've installed drogue-cloud per the\ninstructions,\nalong with a few of its pre-requisites. Specifically, we'll be using\nkubectl and func, discussed below, to deploy our event source and\nservice. And we'll use drg and HTTPie to test it.\nThe KafkaSource\nWe need two things: a knative KafkaSource to forward the Drogue\nCloudEvents, and a knative Service to receive them. Because\ndrogue-cloud is built atop kafka and knative-eventing, the\nKafkaSource custom resource definition (CRD) is already on your\ncluster, along with the topic and bootstrap server listed in the\nfollowing YAML. The only thing you may want to change is the\nconsumerGroup, to ensure the \"sink\" receives all messages. If you\ncreate more than one KafkaSource for the same topic, you probably\nwant to give each a unique consumerGroup name.\napiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1\nkind: KafkaSource\nmetadata:\n  name: drogue-messages\nspec:\n  consumerGroup: some-unique-name\n  bootstrapServers:\n    - kafka-eventing-kafka-bootstrap.knative-eventing.svc:9092\n  topics:\n    - knative-messaging-kafka.drogue-iot.iot-channel\n  sink:\n    ref:\n      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n      kind: Service\n      name: drogue-addict\n\nAssuming you put that YAML in a file named source.yaml you would\napply it like so:\nkubectl apply -f source.yaml\n\nYou can then observe that its status won't become \"Ready\" until we\ncreate the drogue-addict service, configured as its \"sink\" above:\nkubectl get kafkasource\n\nOur Knative Service, built by func\nThe func project aims to simplify the creation of Knative Services\nthat respond to CloudEvents. It was designed to be run as either a\nself-contained CLI or a kn plugin. Unpack the appropriate\nbinary\nsomewhere on your $PATH and run the following to get started:\nfunc create drogue-addict &amp;&amp; cd drogue-addict\n\nThough it supports an ever-expanding variety of popular\nlanguages,\nits default is Node.js, which will serve our purposes for now, since\nwe're just going to log the event we receive, along with the request\ncontext, just to show what data we have to work with.  Overwrite the\nentire index.js file it generated with the following:\n/**\n * Log the drogue event \n *\n * @param {Context} context the invocation context\n * @param {Object} event the CloudEvent \n */\nfunction handle(context, event) {\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(context, null, 2));\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));\n};\n\nmodule.exports = handle;\n\nWe need to build our function image. Unfortunately, func currently\nrequires a docker daemon for this. If you're using podman, you can\nsimulate that like so:\npodman system service --time=0 tcp:localhost:1234 &amp;\nexport DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:1234\n\nWith the daemon configured, we can now deploy our function. We'll need a\ndocker registry to store our image:\nfunc deploy --registry docker.io/&lt;YOUR_ACCOUNT&gt;\n\nTesting our function\nWith any luck, when we publish an event from our \"device\" to the\ndrogue-cloud, that event will be logged by our Node.js function. We can\nsimulate a device sending data using a handy script in the same\ndirectory from which you initially installed drogue-cloud.\nThe script will invoke the Drogue CLI, drg, to first authenticate\nyou, and then create identifiers for your app and device, before\nfinally publishing some fake data for that device.\nThe first time you run it, you should be redirected to your browser\nand prompted for a username and password. Use admin and\nadmin123456, respectively.\ncd &lt;DROGUE_INSTALL_DIR&gt;\n./scripts/publish.sh\n\nAssuming you see HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted output from the script, you\nshould see a pod fire up containing our function:\nkubectl get pod\n\nYou should actually see two pods, one for our drogue-addict\nservice, and one for the KafkaSource since its sink finally showed\nup. But because knative services will scale down to 0 when idle (to\nsave you money!), the pod running our function will only hang around\nfor a few minutes. While it's up, you can run this to view the\nmessages logged by our function:\nkubectl logs -l serving.knative.dev/service=drogue-addict -c user-container --tail=-1\n\nFingers crossed, you'll see something resembling this:\n{\n  \"query\": {},\n  \"body\": {\n    \"temp\": 42\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"host\": \"drogue-addict.default.svc.cluster.local\",\n    \"user-agent\": \"Go-http-client/1.1\",\n    \"content-length\": \"12\",\n    \"accept-encoding\": \"gzip\",\n    \"ce-application\": \"app_id\",\n    \"ce-device\": \"device_id\",\n    \"ce-id\": \"d28078c1-0d91-46aa-9e1c-4a167c237a76\",\n    \"ce-instance\": \"drogue\",\n    \"ce-partitionkey\": \"app%5Fid/device%5Fid\",\n    \"ce-source\": \"drogue://app%5Fid/device%5Fid\",\n    \"ce-specversion\": \"1.0\",\n    \"ce-subject\": \"anything\",\n    \"ce-time\": \"2021-05-27T22:27:30.758332796+00:00\",\n    \"ce-traceparent\": \"00-5a09559ee13eee3072e056b77bfa3656-950ab17c2959f944-00\",\n    \"ce-type\": \"io.drogue.event.v1\",\n    \"content-type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"forwarded\": \"for=172.17.0.9;proto=http\",\n    \"k-proxy-request\": \"activator\",\n    \"traceparent\": \"00-5a09559ee13eee3072e056b77bfa3656-48b4d717feb15d02-00\",\n    \"x-forwarded-for\": \"172.17.0.9, 172.17.0.2\",\n    \"x-forwarded-proto\": \"http\",\n    \"x-request-id\": \"6686fd85-cbaf-490b-a3b0-d1166ca3450a\"\n  },\n  \"method\": \"POST\",\n  \"httpVersion\": \"1.1\",\n  \"httpVersionMajor\": 1,\n  \"httpVersionMinor\": 1,\n  \"log\": {},\n  \"cloudevent\": {\n    \"id\": \"d28078c1-0d91-46aa-9e1c-4a167c237a76\",\n    \"time\": \"2021-05-27T22:27:30.758Z\",\n    \"type\": \"io.drogue.event.v1\",\n    \"source\": \"drogue://app%5Fid/device%5Fid\",\n    \"specversion\": \"1.0\",\n    \"datacontenttype\": \"application/json\",\n    \"subject\": \"anything\",\n    \"application\": \"app_id\",\n    \"device\": \"device_id\",\n    \"instance\": \"drogue\",\n    \"partitionkey\": \"app%5Fid/device%5Fid\",\n    \"traceparent\": \"00-5a09559ee13eee3072e056b77bfa3656-950ab17c2959f944-00\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"temp\": 42\n    }\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"id\": \"d28078c1-0d91-46aa-9e1c-4a167c237a76\",\n  \"time\": \"2021-05-27T22:27:30.758Z\",\n  \"type\": \"io.drogue.event.v1\",\n  \"source\": \"drogue://app%5Fid/device%5Fid\",\n  \"specversion\": \"1.0\",\n  \"datacontenttype\": \"application/json\",\n  \"subject\": \"anything\",\n  \"application\": \"app_id\",\n  \"device\": \"device_id\",\n  \"instance\": \"drogue\",\n  \"partitionkey\": \"app%5Fid/device%5Fid\",\n  \"traceparent\": \"00-5a09559ee13eee3072e056b77bfa3656-950ab17c2959f944-00\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"temp\": 42\n  }\n}\n\nIf you don't see that, run ./scripts/publish.sh again and recheck\nthe logs.\nNow what?\nWe're not entirely sure! Some of this is just meant to show that our\narchitecture -- loosely-coupled Knative services swapping cloud events\n-- is extensible by the same means in which it's implemented. It's\nturtles all the way down!\nThis article exposes some of the drogue-cloud internals, specifically\nthat all IoT events currently flow through a single kafka topic. This\nis likely to change, of course, partially based on whether users will\neven want to introduce their own knative services/functions to extend\nthe platform. We obviously want to ensure users only receive their own\ndevice events in a multi-tenant environment, for example. So in the\nfuture, we might have topics dedicated to particular users or source\ntypes. Or maybe even use entirely different knative abstractions over\nkafka. There's still lots to explore and myriad use cases to support.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/consume-drogue-messages/","title":"Consuming Drogue messages with a Knative Service"},"https://blog.drogue.io/digital-twins/":{"body":"Exchanging messages with devices is great. As I tried to explain in the last blog post about\nthe cloud side of things, having a modular system, and\nnormalizing the transport protocol can make things a lot easier. However, exchanging messages is only the first\nstep towards an IoT application.\nBlinkedy blink\nMaybe you noticed, maybe not … but Rodney blinks, every now and then. Just like devices send data, every now and then.\nAnd it is easy for devices to implement that. A change happens, message sent. That's it.\nHowever, on the consuming side of those changes, receiving the information of a change is equally important as the\ncurrent state of the device. Or maybe event group of devices.\nJust to visualize what I mean. I bet you did take a look Rodney a few seconds back. What you saw, was:\n\nNow you are the process, consuming on the cloud side, and the image is the overall state of your device. You expect\nthe see the full picture, literally. Just assume what it would look like, not having the previous state, only the\nchanges:\n\nIt would start out blank, because you never had the initial state. Then, it would change, but the change itself doesn't\nmake any sense. Neither would the change back.\nFor the device, it would be convenient tough, to only the most recent change. For the network that would be easier to\nhandle as well, as it means less data.\nHowever, for the consuming side, it would be harder to process. Because the information about the current state is\nnot easily available.\nCurrent state\nLet's take a simple dashboard as an example, showing the most recent temperate value. That is easy to implement with\nour current example application. The most recent state of that sensor is always available in our time series database.\nAssuming a more complex example, of a more complex device, with much more data. We cannot push everything into a\ntime series database. That would take up too much space and would also be not feasible for some of the data formats.\nSo we do need some kind of storage, which persists the last known state of a device. And you need a way to keep\nthe data fresh.\nDigital Twin\nThis is where the concept of a digital twin comes into play. Taking a look at Wikipedia:\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity\n\nThis is what many use cases require on the IoT application side. To have a digital representation of your device, \nideally with some magic that keeps the data fresh, providing easy access to it.\nAn important part of this is to know the data structure of your device/entity. In most cases you will have a\nbigger, overall data structure. However, you cannot always transmit the full set of information when changes occur.\nThat is why you need to transmit deltas, in order to keep traffic low. Digital twins help you to structure your device\ndata, and with that, allow you to more easily implement delta\nupdates.\nBut wait, there is more\nDelta update is one aspect a digital twin can help with. With a structured data model, you can also start to\nnormalize data. Maybe define what sensors you have, what actuators, what state they provide, and what operations\nthey can perform. This would allow you to map your different payload structures into re-usable schemas, and re-use\ncode that works with the data as well.\nHaving a structured data model would of course also allow for providing a structured API for your devices. Making it\neasy to interact with them from the cloud side. It also allows to introspec devices, and let users explore devices\ncapabilities.\nBased on a formal device model, it would also be possible to create some tooling around that. For example in the area\nof visualization and mapping. \nHow do we get there?\nSo ideally we would need a way to describe device's data models, a system to store the information in these structures,\na way to interact with that data in a structured way, and an easy way to translate between our device's payload formats\nand the defined models.\nLet's take a look at Eclipse Vorto and Eclipse Ditto.\nVorto describes itself as:\n\nLanguage for Digital Twins\n\nAnd Ditto:\n\n… where IoT devices and their digital twins get together\n\nSounds like a perfect match. No wonder, both communities work together closely, in order to implement a digital twin\nsolution.\nAn example\nSo, let's try integrating this into our cloud side deployment. Currently, our example temperature sensor posts\nJSON snippets like this:\n{ \"temp\": 1.23 }\n\nVery simple and easy to handle. If we would describe this as a Vorto model, this could look like this:\nvortolang 1.0\nnamespace io.drogue.demo\nversion 1.0.0\ndisplayname \"FirstTestDevice\"\ndescription \"Information Model for FirstTestDevice\"\n\nusing org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor.TemperatureSensor ; 1.0.0\n\ninfomodel FirstTestDevice {\n\n\tfunctionblocks {\n\t    mandatory temperature as TemperatureSensor\n\t}\n\n}\n\nMore verbose, true. However, we also get a bunch of features with that. Like versioning, referencing existing data types,\nvalidation, etc. As you can see, we are not defining our own temperature sensor, but already re-use a standard Vorto\nmodel for that: org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor.TemperatureSensor.\nThe public Vorto repository already contains a bunch of models. Like the code that runs the\nrepository, the models can be open source as well. Of course, you can also host how own instance, if that is what\nyou need. But let's re-use the public instance for your example. Our model is published as\nio.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0.\nIf you have deployed the digital twin\ncomponent from drogue-cloud, then you can create a new device in the\nDitto repository like this:\n\n\nExport the device model from the public repository:\nMODEL_ID=io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0\nhttp -do FirstTestDevice.json https://vorto.eclipse.org/api/v1/generators/eclipseditto/models/$MODEL_ID/?target=thingJson\n\n\n\nCreate a new device in Ditto, based on this model:\nDEVICE_ID=my:dev1\nTWIN_API=\"https://ditto:ditto@ditto-console-drogue-iot.apps.my.cluster\"\n\ncat FirstTestDevice.json | http PUT \"$TWIN_API/api/2/things/$DEVICE_ID\"\n\n\n\nNow the Ditto instance is ready to receive updates for this device, in the Ditto Protocol JSON format.\nMapping data\nOne feature of the Vorto repository is, that it can help you create a mapping model for your device model:\n\nYou provide some example data from your device, and fill in expression where to find that data. You can even test the\nmapping directly and check the results.\nOnce you have created the mapping, we need to inject this into our event processing. Now, the modularity and\nflexibility of Knative come into play.\nLet's assume we pull events from a Kafka source:\napiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1\nkind: KafkaSource\nmetadata:\n  name: digital-twin-kafka-source\nspec:\n  consumerGroup: digital-twin\n  bootstrapServers:\n    - kafka-eventing-kafka-bootstrap.knative-eventing.svc:9092\n  topics:\n    - knative-messaging-kafka.drogue-iot.iot-channel\n  sink:\n    ref:\n      apiVersion: flows.knative.dev/v1\n      kind: Sequence\n      name: digital-twin\n\nForward it to the following sequence:\napiVersion: flows.knative.dev/v1\nkind: Sequence\nmetadata:\n  name: digital-twin\nspec:\n  channelTemplate:\n    …\n  steps:\n  - ref:\n      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n      kind: Service\n      name: vorto-converter\n      namespace: drogue-iot\n  reply:\n    ref:\n      kind: Service\n      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n      name: ditto-pusher\n\nThe vorto-converter being a Knative service defined as:\napiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: vorto-converter\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - image: ghcr.io/drogue-iot/vorto-converter:0.1.1\n\nThen that would consume the original device payload from a Kafka topic, and look up the data mapper in the Vorto\nrepository, based on a cloud events extension, containing the model id. The converter is a simple Knative service,\nbased on Quarkus, and can be scaled up as required. The result of this would look like:\n{\n  \"headers\":{\n    \"response-required\":false\n  },\n  \"path\":\"/features\",\n  \"topic\":\"my/dev1/things/twin/commands/modify\",\n  \"value\":{\n    \"temperature\":{\n      \"definition\":[\n        \"org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0\"\n      ],\n      \"properties\":{\n        \"status\":{\n          \"value\": 1.23\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAs you can see from the \"modify\" command, this is already intended to partially update the model, based on the\nnew information. The result would look like:\n{\n    \"attributes\": {\n        \"modelDisplayName\": \"FirstTestDevice\"\n    },\n    \"definition\": \"io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0\",\n    \"features\": {\n        \"temperature\": {\n            \"definition\": [\n                \"org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0\"\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"status\": {\n                    \"value\": 1.23\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"policyId\": \"my:dev1\",\n    \"thingId\": \"my:dev1\"\n}\n\nAs it is a simple model, with only one status value, it doesn't look that different, but I hope you get the idea.\nDeveloping\nGetting the status of a device is easy now. A simple HTTP call is sufficient, and we can get the most recent device\nstate, including all information that our device supports. We have a structured data model, which we can use to build\ntooling and application on, which helps us validate and map the payload that comes from our devices.\nAdditionally, we can also start to search for things like \"all sensors reporting 5 °C or more\", with\na query like: ge(features/temperature/properties/status/value,5.0). So not only can we store device state,\nwe can also use it to find devices, based on their current state.\nWhat's next\nI hope I was able to explain a bit, why the initial overhead of setting up a system like this makes sens, and what\nthe benefits are. To be fair, Knative helps lot getting this deployed on your Kubernetes cluster.\nThere is a lot more you can do with Digital Twins, reconciling desired vs actual state for example. But, I will\nleave that for a future blog post.\nSee also\n\ndrogue-cloud repository\nEclipse Ditto \nEclipse Vorto\nPublic Vorto instance\ndrogue-vorto-converter repository\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/digital-twins/","title":"Digital Twins, and how they can help"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drg-guided-tour/":{"body":"A guided tour of drg, the command line client that aims to make your life easier when interracting with a drogue-cloud instance.\n\ndrg is the newest addition to the drogue family.

This allows you to have multiple instances of drogue-cloud configured to switch back and forth. More on that later !\nCreate and manage applications\nAs you may already know, devices communicate with drogue-cloud in a scoped environment called an Application. You can read more about the drogue cloud concepts in the documentation.\nLet's start by creating an application for the things in my house in our drogue-cloud instance:\ndrg create app house\nApp house created.\n\nThat is neat but it is definitely missing some context. We can also create an entry with some more context in the spec section:\ndrg create app french-house --spec '{\"location\":\"france\"}'\nApp french-house created.\n\nYou can also read data from a file: drg create app house -f /path/to/json/file. Please note in that case the json file must describe the whole object. Here is an example:\n{\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"name\": \"french-house\"\n  },\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"location\": \"france\"\n  }\n}\n\nBut let's say I moved to a new country as I need to improve my german. Let's fix that ! drg edit will spawn you a neat editor:\n\nApplications can also be updated reading files : drg update app -f /path/to/app/json/file. \nMake sure you retrieve the full metadata object before doing an update (drg get app house will help you do that) because \nyou need to provide some other data for an update, such as the unique id of the app and its resource version!\nAnd of course, if you sell your house you can always remove it from the system:\n drg delete house french-house\n\nCreate and manage devices\nSo now that we have a good idea of how to manage our house scope let's add devices:\ndrg create device fridge --app=house\n\nThe behaviour is the same as for the applications, so you can create from a file, update, edit and so on...\ndrg create device coffee-machine --app=house -f /path/to/device/json\ndrg update device coffee-machine --app=house\n\nI am starting to get annoyed by the --app argument... It's needlessly repetitive. Let's pull it from the environment:\nexport DRG_APP=house\ndrg create device fridge\n\nThe app setting is now pulled from the env variable. Less keystrokes! Yay! \nIt can also be pulled from the context, that leads nicely into the configuration section, see below.\nContexts and configuration file\nAs I said in the beginning drg can keep track of multiple clusters if the need arises. Let's explain how that works. \nThe configuration file contains multiple contexts. A context represents a cluster API endpoint, a default application (optional) and an authentication token (0Auth2).\nWhen we logged in to a cluster at the beginning we saved a context with a name. Let's say we named it my-cluster, we can set a default app for it:\n drg context set-default-app house --context=my-cluster\n\nNote: here the --context argument is optional as a default context can be pulled from the environment variable DRG_CONTEXT. \nAlso, when you log into a cluster without previous info in the config file (i.e. running drg loginfor the first time), the new context will be set as active by default. \nBut my-cluster is not a really great name, as we just moved it to an Azure cluster. Let's make it clearer:\ndrg context rename my-cluster azure.\n\nYou can list, delete, set another context as active and show the config file.\nWhat's next ?\nWe have a nice long list of things we want to add in drg!\nHere are the high priority items:\n\nlist devices and apps\nSupport JSON PATCH to update resources\nSending commands to devices using the command and control feature of drogue cloud.\nTap into a stream of telemetry and see the stream on your console.\n\nYou can go and look in the issue section of the repo for more details and submit your awesone ideas there.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drg-guided-tour/","title":"drg for easy drogue cloud administration tasks"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drg-trust/":{"body":"This article shows how you can setup X.509 certificates to authenticate devices connecting to Drogue Cloud and an example of how drg makes it easy.\nX509 Authentication?\nIf you are already know how chains of trust works with X509 certs feel free to skip to the next part. Here is a quick explanation otherwise:\nBefore delving into certificates, you need to know they rely on asymmetric cryptography. In short, asymmetric cryptography is a technique that enables encryption and decryption of data with two keys.\nLet's take a key pair (A, B): stuff encrypted with key A can only be decrypted with key B, and vice versa. In the certificates implementation of this technique, we name this key pair (Public, Private).\nYou already use X509 and trust anchors in your daily life, right on this very blog! It's the famous green padlock showing you can trust the connection is secure.\nBut how could you trust that, if that is the first time you visit this website ?\nThe security relies on a shared trusted entity. It's the same mechanism that you use when you accept bank notes from someone, you know the value is real because you trust the bank that created them.\nIn the X509 spec, the common entity that both parties trust is called a trust anchor. There is a nice twist: x509 certificates are harder to counterfeit than banknotes!\nWhen you connect to blog.drogue.io, the server presents to your browser a certificate containing its public key. This certificate is signed using a trust anchor's private key.\nAs you already know and trust this trust anchor, you can verify the certificate by using the trust anchor's public key. \nOnce you verified the certificate, you can trust it, because the anchor said it's worthy.\nThat's the jist of it! X509 has a lot of other details to know about, but that overview is enough for now. \nClient-side certificates\nDrogue-cloud supports authenticating devices using client certificates.\nThe use of X.509 certificates simplifies the process of device authentication, providing a one-to-many relationship between an application and its devices.\nX.509 certificates provide stronger client authentication compared to access tokens or username-password combinations because the private key never leaves the device.\nClient certificates\nThe authentication flow using a client-side certificate is the same as explained earlier: the device, when connecting to drogue-cloud, presents a certificate. \nDrogue-cloud then verifies the signature on the certificate to authenticate the device.\nApplication trust anchor\nTo be able to verify the certificate, we need to set up a common trust anchor between the device and Drogue cloud.\nWe will do that by generating a public/private key pair. This key pair is used to sign a certificate. This self-signed certificate is then attached to an application. \nNow the private key of the application can be used to sign certificates of devices, which will then be presented at the time of authentication.\nSetting things up\nIn this example we will use our Drogue command line tool, drg, as it makes some steps easier. \nSee how to install drg and login to a Drogue Cloud instance here.\nTo know more about how to use drg for managing apps and devices, you can check out this blog.\nDISCLAIMER: Some features used in this walkthrough are not yet released. To reproduce them you'll need to install drg from source and deploy drogue-cloud from the latest available images.\nYou can try to use our development deployment, at your own risk! \nWe will also show how to set up a trust anchor manually.\nYou will need a running drogue-cloud instance, obviously! You can use the sandbox we provide.\nAdd the application trust anchor\nIf you don't already have one, let's create an application and call it demo-app:\ndrg create app demo-app\n\nNow, we need to create a keypair and a self-signed certificate to add a new trust anchor (a.k.a. CA certificate) to the application object.\nWe also specify a 'key-output' to save the private key on our system. This key file is important, as it will be used later to sign device certificates.\ndrg trust create demo-app --key-output demo-app-key.pem\n\nUnder the hood, drg does 3 steps: \n\nCreate a key pair for the application. \nGenerate and sign a certificate with thoses keys\nUpload the serialized (PEM format) certificate in the spec section of the application, base64 encoded.\n\nGenerate a certificate for the device\nThen we will set up a certificate for a device within this application. If necessary, you can create one called demo-device:\ndrg create device demo-device --app demo-app\n\nNow the last thing we need is to generate a certificate for the device, and then sign it using our application trust anchor:\ndrg trust enroll demo-device  --app demo-app --ca-key demo-app-key.pem --out dcert.pem --key-output dkey.pem\n\nLet's break down all the arguments used here:\n\n--app : the application to use as a trust anchor. The device must belong to that app.\n--device: the device ID of the device we want a certificate for.\n--ca-key: the private key of the app trust anchor, used to sign the device's certificate.\n--out: the output file to save the signed device certificate and public key. \n--key-output: the output file to save the device private key.\n\nHere, dcert.pem will contain the certificate the device will be presenting at the time of authentication.\nDevice name alias\ndrg handles the certificate generation, signing, and also does an extra step: it adds an alias for the device. \nIn order to successfully authenticate, a device must have a name matching its certificate's \"SUBJECT-DN\" field.\nThe default (when created by drg) looks like this: CN=&lt;deviceId&gt;, O=Drogue IoT, OU=&lt;appId&gt;. This is not a great device name when it comes to management, so we use an alias here. \nYou can add custom aliases for devices with drg: drg set alias &lt;deviceID&gt; &lt;newAlias&gt;. Note that aliases can be used interchangeably for device authentication, but not for device management.\nUsing the certificate\nThe process is now complete and we can use the freshly signed certificate and private key to authenticate our device to Drogue Cloud! \nTo simulate the process of a device sending some data to the cloud over MQTT, let's use the MQTT CLI tool:\nmqtt -h &lt;host&gt; -p &lt;port&gt; --cert dcert.pem --key dkey.pem -t &lt;topic&gt; -m &lt;message&gt;\n\nHurray! Your message is published, the device was sucessfully authenticated.\nBonus features\ndrg packs a few more features to give you more flexibility.\nChanging the signature algorithm\nThe signature algorithm used to sign the app and device certificates is by default set to EdDSA, but it can be changed by specifying the --algo parameter. \nThe supported signature algorithms are RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA. An example of using RSA:\ndrg trust create --app demo-app --algo RSA --key-output demo-app-key.pem\n\nYou can also change the default signature algorithm for your context:\ndrg context set-default-algo RSA\n\nUsing existing key pairs\nYou may have an existing key pair that you would like to use for the App or device certificate. This can be done easily with the --key-input parameter. \nThe private key needs to be in PKCS8 format to be parsed by drg. Let's look at an example to generate a key using OpenSSL.\nTo generate RSA key: openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\nTo convert this key into the required PKCS8 format:\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform der -on key.pem &gt; private.pk8\n\nNow, it is ready to be supplied to drg\ndrg trust create --app demo-app --key-input private.pk8\n\nIf there are some more bonus features that you would like to see in drg please let us know by opening a request!\nAlternative: do everything manually with OpenSSL\nIf you like getting your hands dirty with OpenSSL, here are the steps to do all that manually: \nGenerate the certificate for the application :\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout app-key.pem -out app-cert.pem -days 365 -subj \"/O=Drogue IoT/OU=Cloud/CN=demo-app\"\n\nNow upload the application certificate to drogue cloud (drg edit application demo-app). The spec should look like this: \n\"spec\" : {\n      \"trustAnchors\": {\n                   \"anchors\": [ \n                          { \"certificate\": \"&lt;cert content goes here&gt;\"} \n                          ]\n                   }\n        }\n}\n\nThe certificate key must contain the whole certificate serialized as PEM.\nThen generate a certificate signing request for the device and sign it\nopenssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout device-private.pem -days 365 -subj \"/O=Drogue IoT/OU=app1/CN=device\" &gt; device-cert.req\ncat device-cert.req | openssl x509 -req -extfile ca.cnf -extensions \"san_ext\" -out device.crt -days 3650 -CA app-cert.pem -CAkey app-key.pem -set_serial 2\n\nWith the ca.cnf file as follows: \n[san_ext]\n\nextendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth\n\nDon't forget to create an alias entry for your device as explained in the \"Device name alias\" paragraph, and you should be good to go!\nSpecial thanks\nThanks to Vedang who did all the implementation work to make certificates easy with drg. This work was done as a Google Summer of Code project. \nYou can read his writeup on his personnal blog.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drg-trust/","title":"Using X509 Client certificates for devices authentication with drogue-cloud"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-eight/":{"body":"This is our \"end of the year\" release, and we did want to focus on improving what we already have, rather than\nintroducing a bunch of new functionality, before leaving for the holiday season/Christmas. So we put a lot of\neffort into cleaning up, filling some gaps that we identified, and polish the current functionality.\nImproved web console\nWe believe that the web console plays an important role into getting started with Drogue Cloud. Sure, once your know\nyour way around, a CLI like drg or directly using our REST API might better for you. But until that point, the\nweb console should allow you the get the basics done in a manual way.\nThat is why we expanded the current functionality of the web console with features that already had been available\nunder the hood. Adding users to an application, transferring ownership, or directly monitoring traffic from the\napplication view for example.\n\nAs always, we will also update our public sandbox with the most recent, released version. So you can directly try out\nthe new features.\nKafka topic provisioning, reloaded!\nIn 0.7 we introduced Kafka topic provisioning, using Strimzi. Creating a new application will automatically spin up\na new Kafka topic for it, and setup access. We already designed this as an extension point, so that one could drop\nin an alternative implementation of that.\nWell, in 0.8 we did that. In addition to the Strimzi based topic provisioner, we added a plain Kafka Admin client\nbased one. And while the downside is, that this cannot create a new user for the consuming side for you, it has the\nbenefit that it works with any Kafka service that provides the Kafka Admin API.\nWe will follow up with an additional blog post on this the near future. So, stay tuned if you are interested!\nImproved gateway device support\nDuring the authentication and authorization process of devices, we already supported the idea of a gateway. However,\nonce the device was connected, we didn't. For session-less protocols (like HTTP or CoAP) this didn't really matter.\nFor MQTT however, it does. MQTT allows a device to connect (and authenticate). If however that device is a\ngateway, it should be able to publish on behalf of other devices, without the need to reconnect.\nSo for Drogue Cloud 0.8, we added the ability for MQTT to authorize publish (events) and subscribe (commands) operations\nindependently of the MQTT connection phase. Meaning: MQTT gateways can now act on behalf of other devices, if they are\nconfigured to allow this. As the concept existed before 0.8, no new configuration had to be added, just the APIs for the\nMQTT endpoint got extended to support this.\nStatic server binary\nDeploying a complex, cloud native stack like Drogue Cloud can be tricky. We put a lot of effort in our installer scripts\nand Helm charts to make it both easy and customizable. However, every now and then, it would be nice to \"just run\"\nDrogue Cloud. With 0.8, you can!\nAssuming you have an existing Kafka, Keycloak, and PostgreSQL instance, it is as easy as:\ndrogue-cloud-server run --enable-all\n\nAnd, it also works on Apple M1 machines. Does it bring all the features? No, it can't. There are a few that we will\nadd in future releases, but we are not planning to re-invent Kubernetes. Does it run on a Raspberry Pi too?\nProbably, we didn't have the time yet to try out. But we definitely want to get there.\nIf you are curious, you can read more about it in a previous blog post or\nin our documentation.\nMore workshops\nThe idea behind our workshops is to give you concrete examples on how to use Drogue Device and Drogue Cloud. And to\nenable you, to replicate this on your own. And since the last release, we added two more workshops to our list.\nEclipse IoT package – Telemetry end-to-end\nThe first one was in the making for quite some time. It shows the integration of a handful of IoT related open source\nprojects from Eclipse IoT. And so this is in fact not a Drogue IoT workshop, but an Eclipse IoT package\nnamed Telemetry end-to-end.\nIt showcases the use case of telemetry data acquisition, from a Drogue Device based microcontroller,\nthrough an Eclipse Kura IoT gateway, into Drogue Cloud. On the cloud side we have Eclipse Ditto as digital twin platform\nand Eclipse Streamsheets to visualize the data. All you need is a micro:bit v2, a Raspberry Pi, and your local machine.\nIt also showcases how important the ability to integrate is. All these different projects, developed by different\ncommunities, can still work together to solve problems on the different layers of an IoT stack. Try it out, and maybe\nreplace a component yourself.\nOf course, you can also cheat and just focus on the cloud side running on your laptop. Should you want to skip on buying\na few new toys to play with.\nFrom WiFi to Websocket\nThis example walks you through a set of steps, creating your own microcontroller firmware, measuring a temperature,\nand sending that to the cloud. Heard that before? Well sure, not only is this our prime example for the use\ncase of sending telemetry data to the cloud, we also have a few other examples doing the same. Just not one that is a\ncomplete workshop, including a WiFi based firmware.\nOn the cloud side, the workshop focuses on re-using an existing Drogue cloud instance. You still host the cloud\napplication, the part which consumes the device data, yourself. And as always, you are also able to run Drogue Cloud\nyourself.\nBut the focus of this tutorial is to re-use existing cloud services, to host all functionality on infrastructure managed\nby someone else.\nThere are two examples of how to consume data using WebSockets. A custom WebAssembly application and a ready-to-use\nTimescaleDB/Grafana dashboard. They represent a good starting point for developing IoT applications based on\nDrogue Cloud.\nFollow-ups\nAPI keys, which we renamed to \"access tokens\" in 0.8, can now be used in more situations, like accessing the device\nmanagement API. This allows you to more easily create applications, which struggle with the OAuth2 way of doing things.\nIn 0.7 we also switched the time-series database of our example to TimescaleDB. Thanks for some help from Timescale,\nwe have been able to really improve this part of the example. Many thanks for that. If you are interested, take a look.\nOur CLI companion tool drg has also been released as 0.8.0, to catch up with API changes. We also added a new\nsubcommand: admin which helps you to manage applications, users, and transfer ownership, as well as manage access\ntokens for all your consuming apps.\nWhat's next\nThere are two major topics we want to tackle in 2022: digital twins and observability of the infrastructure. Both topics\nare quite complex, so don't expect them to land right away in the next release.\nDigital twins are important as a development model for IoT application. And while we already have a brief demo with\nEclipse Ditto, we want to expand this integration, and make it much more useful.\nHaving metrics and tracing in the different services is a pre-requisite for scale testing. We are building this for\nscalability, so we need be able to gather some data around this. And again, this will be a bigger topic for 2022.\nOf course, we also have some mid-term goals. More examples and workshops is definitely on our roadmap. If you have\ninteresting topics you would like us to cover, reach out! A Quarkus based self-service Web UI for our temperature demo,\nbeefing up the Bluetooth gateway application for edge devices, improving application integration for the cloud in different development environments, improving the off-the shelf Grafana dashboard experience, and an OPC UA example\nare all things we would like to get ready in the next cycle too.\nAnd the next release cycle will probably be a bit longer, thanks to a few days of cookies, gifts, and time to\nrecharge batteries. 😉\nAlso see\n\nReleases\nPublic sandbox\nServer binary\nWorkshops\n\nEclipse IoT Package - Telemetry end-to-end\nFrom WiFi to Websocket\n\n\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-eight/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.8.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-eleven/":{"body":"This release is another release with a focus on improving existing functionality. The reason for this is simple: it works just fine. True, there is always room for improvement, but also to build upon what is\nthere, so maybe, read on …\nTLS improvements\nCoAP finally has support for DTLS. DTLS is a variant of TLS, but based on UDP, which is used by CoAP. The CoAP\nendpoint originated from a Google Summer of Code project. But DTLS support was excluded, as this would have been too much for one summer. This has changed now, and the new release supports CoAP with DTLS.\nWhen using CoAP with DTLS, it makes sense to also support TLS-PKS, which we so far didn't support. TLS-PKS uses\na simple \"pre shared key\", instead of a TLS session handshake and certificates. This speeds up establishing TLS\nconnections, and also reduces the work devices have to perform in order to connect to a TLS based services.\nA feature which makes sense, which thinking about tiny devices, using CoAP.\nWith the new release, we do support TLS-PSK for all endpoints, not only CoAP, but for HTTP and MQTT too.\nDependencies &amp; Quality of life improvements\nFrom a user perspective, it is hardly worth mentioning. But, quite some time went into updating\ndependencies for this release. From the build system up to the frontend. Keycloak, Kafka, Kubernetes, but also\nGitHub Actions Runners … everyone is updating something, and we did catch up.\nAnd there are a bunch of minor improvements, like new UI features in the console, CORS support for the HTTP endpoint, more knobs in the Helm charts.\nBug fixes and performance improvements 😉\nMore integration examples\nDrogue Cloud doesn't require you to use any specific device or SDK. We want to make it easy for devices to\nconnect and communicate with the cloud, and not create another closed IoT ecosystem.\nThis is already possible, and just to show you \"how\", we added two more examples:\n\nhttps://github.com/drogue-iot/micropython-examples\nhttps://github.com/drogue-iot/arduino-examples\n\nBoth examples target microcontrollers, with existing, well known platforms (MicroPython and Arduino). As you\ncan see, it only takes a few lines to connect to the cloud side.\nDigital twin\nSo, if we didn't implement a bunch of new features in Drogue Cloud, what did we do instead (I mean aside from\nEclipseCon)?\nDigital twin! We mentioned in the last release blog post that we needed some more time to think about it. And so we did.\nDrogue Cloud is intended to normalize IoT connectivity.\nDrogue Doppelgänger is there to normalize IoT payload.\nAnd once you've normalized payload, you also want to work with the data. And some tasks are just so common that\nit makes sense to provide them out of the box. One might call that \"IoT middleware\", or \"Digital Twin\", as it\nworks with the mirrored state of the devices. The name of the project is\nDoppelgänger, and it mainly provides digital twin functionality.\nThe goals of Doppelgänger are:\n\nWork with any IoT connectivity layer: True, we focus on Drogue Cloud. But with a bit of code, it should easily be possible to attach it to e.g. a standard MQTT broker.\nNormalize IoT payload: The tricky part. As you never know what data you get, unless you adopt some existing schema. And this is what we aim for. We do have a simple internal data model, which should be able to support existing data models, like OPC UA. And like the connectivity layer, we provide a translation layer to convert data into the Doppelgänger thing model.\nProvide out of the box functionality to work with data: Renaming properties, transforming values, evaluating state, reconciling between desired and actual state, aggregating data, building thing relations.\nProvide APIs to the things state and configuration: not only our own APIs, but also support APIs like OPC UA or Web of Things.\n\nSo, if these are the goals, what is the current state of the project? We do have a 0.1 release. That sounds early, and it is. But it is the right time to check it out, and come up with your feedback 😉.\nAnd just to make you a bit curious, here are a few features the 0.1 release already brings:\n\nIoT connectivity with Drogue Cloud\nUpdating state from JSON messages\nState reconciliation with custom JavaScript code (based on state change, timers, or lifecycle events)\nState aggregation and a dynamic hierarchy using references\nValidation of the things state using a JSON Schema\nReconciliation of desired state based on actual state (e.g. drive the actual state towards the desired state using commands, with re-try and scripts)\nSubscribing to the thing state using WebSocket and OPC UA\n\nWe do have a set of example snippets which might show this in a more technical way.\n\n\nRoot of the hierarchy in the debugger web application\n\n\n\nA thing in the web debugger\n\n\n\nThe same hierarchy in an OPC UA client\n\n\n\nA desired value sync in action\n\nAnd to give you a bit of context to the screenshots, this shows the web based debugger on a Doppelgänger instance we used for the IoT hackathon at EclipseCon 2022. The data came from micro:bits, through a Bluetooth Mesh network, connected via gateways to Drogue Cloud. The OPC UA twin integration shows the same data, just using OPC UA as the API instead of a simple WebSocket API.\nWhat's next\nThere are some bigger topics to tackle, presumably these are all tasks for 2023.\nScale testing\nWe tested several aspects of the performance, but we never did a scale test to push the system to its limit.\nAnd once we do, I am sure we will find something to fix.\nSo part of next year we will be looking into scale testing, in order to come up with some numbers, and\nmaybe some nice charts.\nDigital twin\nWe only got started with digital twin. It is a 0.1 release, and some basic tasks still need to be completed.\nBut we already have some ideas on what to do next:\n\nSupporting additional data models and APIs: VSS, Web of Things, Asset Administration Shell come into our mind.\nAdding support for WebAssembly in addition to JavaScript code.\nTaking Doppelgänger to the Edge, running some workload on the edge, and building a hierarchy of twins.\n\nThere are so many possibilities, and we would encourage you to\nreach out to us, and let us know what is important for you. This helps us\nprioritize, and gives you the opportunity to steer the project in a direction that helps you most.\nBut of course, contribution in the form of code is also very welcome 😉 \nAlso see\n\nReleases\nPublic sandbox\nDrogue Doppelgänger\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-eleven/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.11.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-five/":{"body":"Today we released Drogue Cloud 0.5.0. It brings together a lot of things that have been cooking for a while. \nAPI revamp\nIn the past we have been adding API endpoints and structures as we needed them. We knew that at some point, we needed\nto revisit this and iron it out a bit. This release, it was time to focus on this.\nNot only did we create an OpenAPI 3 specification, which gets deployed using SwaggerUI alongside the console,\nwe also have a Rust client ready to use. Indeed, we are using that\nourselves ;-)\nTurns out, we didn't need to change much. It mostly was cleaning it up a bit. But it also turns out, we will need to\nrevisit this again in the future. There are a few items that are missing (like bulk operations, JSON patch support, or\nan aggregated API endpoint). Still, it is a big step forward, and future changes should be more additions, rather than\nrefactorings.\nThe Things Network operator\nIn 0.4.0 we added registry change events,\nand we mentioned \"The Things Network\" (TTN), as an example to reconcile devices with. Well, we just implemented that.\nYou can now create a new application and Drogue Cloud, add some devices, and have that sync with The Things Network once\nyou provided a TTN API key. As yes, we are using the v3 API!\nOf course this is only the first example what you can do with this. In the future, we plan to add some more \"operators\",\nto reconcile with additional systems: Apache Kafka, Knative, Eclipse Ditto, and whatever comes up. Of course, if\nyou have some ideas yourself, we are welcome to share your thoughts.\nAPI access tokens\nFor the newly introduced MQTT integration,\napplications consuming data from the system using MQTT, we had implemented OAuth2 tokens for authenticating MQTT clients.\nTurns out, yes this works, but not very well with most MQTT clients. A typical alternative to OAuth tokens for\nservice-to-service authentication are access tokens (aka API keys, API tokens, …). So we added support for those as well.\nWith Drogue Cloud 0.5.0, you can create (list and revoke) access tokens, which you can use as an alternative mechanism\nfor authenticating towards the MQTT integration. Other services will most likely follow in a future release. They\neven have an initial page in the web console:\n\nAn end-to-end workshop with Drogue Device\nThe main focus of the release though, was to show a proper end-to-end example. As mentioned earlier, this release\nfinally brought together all the required components and features to create a proper end-to-end example. We chose\na use-case of a LoRaWAN device, reporting its current state to the cloud, receiving back commands.\nIn order to make this lightweight, as-a-service, and easy to develop, we chose to run Drogue IoT as a service\n(which you can do yourself), and deploy a small Quarkus application, connecting via our MQTT integration for telemetry\ndata and sending commands.\nThis allows you to run the Quarkus application on your local machine, reaching out to a public Drogue IoT instance,\nwhich is interconnected with The Things Network, acting as a LoRaWAN provider.\n\nTrue, there are other ways to deal with connectivity. Both on the device side, as well as on the cloud side. However,\nusing this example, you can easily run this on your local machine. And, you can use any MQTT tool you already have, for\ndebugging.\nIn order to replicate this yourself, we compiled a complete end-to-end workshop in our book. Having the right hardware,\nthat should allow you to re-create this yourself: Drogue Device, TTN, Drogue Cloud, Quarkus!\nHarder, Better, Faster, Stronger\nA lot of minor things have been improved and fixed. Support for deployments on GKE, an about dialog in the web console,\ndrg has been improved as well: Search, improved login, support for Brew, a Windows binary, and\nmore. \n\nWhat's next\nUnfortunately we didn't get the resource sharing done in time. So inviting members to your application needs to wait\nfor 0.6. We also found a few areas where we need to improve the experience in writing operators for the device registry.\nDefinitely, we also want to create more workshops. There are already so many variants you could use Drogue IoT with.\nWe just need to document them, in an easy to consume way.\nWhen it comes to Kafka, we also want to improve the way a user, or application, can configure its topics. A single\ntopic down to a dedicated topic per channel.\nAs always, you are welcome to join and give it a try on our sandbox.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-five/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.5.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-four/":{"body":"Today we released Drogue Cloud 0.4.0. This is a huge step forward in so many areas, let's take a look.\nOwnership of resources\nThe previous release did not have any ownership of resources. It was a conscious decision we made, as we wanted to\nrelease early, and also make the sandbox instance available for people to try out.\nThis release picked up that remaining task, and introduces the ownership of resources. Leveraging the existing OAuth2\nintegration to not only authenticate users, but also to authorize their requests.\nWith that, it is no longer possible to read any application or device, or consume any message stream. You may only\naccess the resources you own. For now, that is a very basic access model, but we will improve that over time.\nAlong with that, we also improved the validation of devices and their gateways. When a gateway acts on behalf of a\ndevice, we now verify that the gateway is authorized to do so. Currently, this is possible by assigning one or\nmore gateways explicitly to a device, but we already have plans to do this for a group (or label) based mapping.\nTokens all the way\nIn the previous release we already had OAuth2 and Open ID connect, but we mostly used it for the web console.\nIn 0.4, all the services, even internal ones, use OAuth2 tokens for performing authentication.\nWe also integrated the Eclipse Ditto, digital twin, instance with the single sign-on instance of Drogue Cloud.\nCommand line interface\nA downside of using tokens is that you always need a fresh one. Acquiring tokens is an extra step and tokens\nare a bit complicated when using a simple http client on the command line. \nSo, it was time to start working on a command line client, which takes away all the \"glue operations\" required to\nexchange tokens in order to interact with Drogue Cloud. Of course, that client now handles all the tokens, refreshes\nthem when necessary, and helps you acquire an initial token using the browser flow. Just run:\ndrg login https://api.sandbox.drogue.cloud\n\nAnd, you will be guided through the login process. Once you have a valid token, you can create applications and\ndevices just like:\ndrg create app my-app\ndrg create device --app my-app my-device\n\nAs always, this is just the beginning. We now have a solid foundation, which allows us to build on top of this. You may\nfind our backlog of ideas right here: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drg/issues\nThe integration device registry\nThe device registry also received a lot of attention during the 0.4 release cycle. One part was definitely the\nintroduction of access control, which impacted the device registry most. But we also beefed up the APIs a lot.\nBorrowing ideas from Kubernetes, e.g. annotations, labels, finalizers, soft-delete, generation and resource version, …\nFinalizers, for devices? Well, a major new feature of the device registry also is the ability to send out change events.\nChange events, finalizers, and the ability to use optimistic locking allow us to create controllers (or operators) for\nthe device registry.\nThe idea is pretty simple: No IoT solution can stay on its own, it is the \"Internet of Things\", not the\n\"Silo of Things\". For that we need to integrate with other systems. And, most systems already come with the concept of\na device registry. So most systems expect you to create resources, like a device, in their system as well.\nLet's take the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) system for a second. You might have read our blog posts about setting that\nup with Drogue Cloud. That requires you to create an application and device in our system, and an application and device\nin their system. Why not simply create an application in our system, add some \"TTN API token\" and let it reconcile\nthe devices from Drogue Cloud to TTN?\nYou see, that opens up a lot of possibilities, and makes things a lot easier.\nCommand &amp; Control\nCommand and control learned a few new tricks as well. The most noteworthy one might be the fact that it can deal with\nexternal command endpoints now.\nSo far we had been able to send command to devices when that where connected. Like an MQTT subscription, or an HTTP long\npolling operation.\nNow, we can also send commands to gateways, or services, when a device is not directly connected. Let's come back to\nthe TTN example: The TTN API allows you to send a command for a device at any time. It will take care of the delivery\nto the device.\nYou can now configure a device in Drogue Cloud to leverage this functionality. The same command API on the Drogue Cloud\nside, that normally sends to connected devices, can now also use a pre-configured external command endpoint.\nIntegrations\nNaming things is hard. So far, Drogue Cloud had the ability to let users consume messages from the internal Kafka topic.\nAnd, while consuming directly from Kafka is a nice idea, or letting Knative eventing push you some HTTP events, a lot\nof people currently use e.g. MQTT to consume IoT related messages.\nThat is why we created an MQTT service, which allows you to consume messages coming from devices, using MQTT. Both MQTT v3.1.1 and v5 are supported. You can receive messages using Cloud Events structured or binary format, and also have\nthe ability to use \"shared consumers\", to split the load between different MQTT consumers.\nWe definitely want to expand this concept in future releases. AMQP 1.0 and simple websockets might be good additional\nprotocols to implement.\nThe hardest parts was: what do you call those services? We ended up with \"Integrations\", because it allows you to\nintegrate your application, that wants to interface with your devices, with Drogue Cloud. Using a technology that you\nprefer.\nBug fixes and performance improvements\nOf course there is a huge list of minor things that we did as well, like improving the web console, simplifying the\nendpoint configuration, improved health endpoints, … you know: bug fixes and performance improvements!\n\nWhat's next\nFor you? Try it out! Definitely! The simplest way to do this is to head over to the sandbox and give it a try:\nhttps://sandbox.drogue.cloud\nFor us? There is a long list of things that we would like to improve in the current system, like proper QoS 1 handling\nwith the MQTT integration. Or the long list of improvements we put down for drg. Definitely we want to showcase the device registry integration capabilities by implementing the \"The Things Network\"\noperator. Letting Drogue Cloud manage devices on the TTN side.\nThen again, it is an open source project. You are welcome to join the project, and let us know what you would like to\nsee next. Have a chat with us, and maybe even start working on topics that would make your life easier.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-four/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.4.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-nine/":{"body":"A lot has happened since the last release of Drogue Cloud. Unfortunately, the only thing that seems to stick out\nis the ongoing war in Ukraine. And whatever you think might have led to this, there is never, ever a justification\nfor bombing the civilian population of a country. So, in a situation like that, can we simply celebrate what we achieved\nin Drogue IoT, like we usually do? I believe the answer to that must be \"yes\". Do what you think is right, but also\nfocus on the positive! Because otherwise the terrorists have won!\nApplication monitoring: Metrics and Tracing\nI am not sure if I need to advertise the benefits of application monitoring. We wanted to have that for a while. Not only\nas a feature, but actually for using that ourselves in our public sandbox. And, as we have been testing performance and\nthroughput, having metrics and tracing comes in handy too.\nDrogue Cloud 0.9 exposes metrics using a Prometheus endpoint and supports tracing with Jaeger tracing out of the box.\nWhen it comes to tracing, we not only support Jaeger, but we are tapping into the Rust ecosystem of\ntracing and opentelemetry.\nHowever, that doesn't come out-of-the-box.\nDigital twin: Early Eclipse Ditto™ integration\nDrogue Cloud's current focus is on IoT connectivity. But we definitely want to have an (optional)\nintegration with a digital twin component too. So, why not go ahead and bring together Drogue Cloud and\nEclipse Ditto?\nEclipse Ditto is an open source digital twin solution, and sounds like a perfect fit. Bringing those two together took\na bit of an effort, and isn't fully finished yet. This will be a topic, that for sure spans over multiple releases.\nHowever, a lot of things are already in good shape, and I would also encourage you to try it out. The existing\ndigital twin Helm charts have been adapted to install the integration if you opt-in for that. When you installed it,\nyou can:\n\nEnable an application in Drogue Cloud for Ditto\n\nThis will set up the connection between Drogue Cloud and Ditto\nAnd create the necessary policies\n\n\nEnable devices in Drogue Cloud to be mapped to Eclipse Ditto\n\nWhich creates matching \"things\" in Ditto\nAnd applies the correct policy\n\n\nDelete resources on the Drogue Cloud side, which will synchronize this with the Ditto side\n\nYou can track the remaining items here: drogue-iot/drogue-cloud#223\nIs Eclipse Ditto the only thing that we have in mind? No. Ditto is a powerful beast. But it also has quite an appetite\nfor resources. Not everyone might need all the bells and whistles, so we are still investigating other options too. In\nthe end, there is no plan for have a single solution, but to allow integrating with more than one.\nUpdating dependencies\nSounds boring? True! However, this time, we were a bit excited about that. To understand this, let's have a closer look\ninto Rust, its dependencies, and Tokio.\nRust follows a semantic versioning scheme. And a core dependency of many Rust applications that\ndeal with I/O and need an asynchronous executor, is tokio. Now, for a long time, tokio was released\nas 0.2, which was the basis for a lot of other libraries.\nAt some point tokio 1.0 was released, with great joy. Now the problem is that tokio 0.2 and 1.0 are not compatible\nby definition. Also, due to the fact that Tokio provides an asynchronous executor, you cannot just mix 0.2 and 1.0\nin a single application (that easily). On the bright side, the migration wasn't that difficult, and so may libraries\ndid this, and released new versions of themselves too.\nWith one exception, that was actix. We use actix for HTTP endpoints, and there are a bunch of\nextensions on top of actix (like metrics, CORS, OAuth2), which make your life a lot easier. On the other side, e.g. the\nasynchronous PostgreSQL driver was a thing we didn't want to miss. So we carefully curated our dependencies until\nthere was a beta version of actix-web, which supported tokio 1.0. So we migrated to that in the hope that, like most\nother libraries, there would be a release soon, which would adopt tokio 1.0.\nThat was several Drogue Cloud releases back. Actix decided to do all kind of breaking changes too, because in the end,\nthe migration to tokio 1.0 also was a breaking change.\nA few weeks back, actix-web 4 was finally released. And with that, most on-top features, like the Cloud Events SDK, too.\nFinally, we could drop a lot of carefully curated \"beta\" dependencies and git patches from our Cargo.toml files.\nSure, we also updated Strimzi, Keycloak, and a bunch of other dependencies. But none of these felt as good as ripping\noff all the duct tape.\nImprove frontend build\nAnother dependency we updated was Yew. Yew is the web frontend framework we use for the Web Assembly\nbased console we have. We skipped one release (0.18), because we knew that the next release (0.19) would break things\nagain. So migrating from 0.17 to 0.19 wasn't a simple task, but it also was the right time to get rid of another\nnuisance: Webpack!\nIf you live in the JavaScript world, you might know webpack. It is the go-to tool for compiling web frontend\napplication and bundling it up. If you have a JavaScript allergy, like I have, you might have a hard time with that\ntool. Especially, as wasm and webpack don't really play well together.\nIn the Rust world however, there is a new tool available: trunk. Trunk does the same job that\nwebpack does. Just in a much saner way (and webpack fans might disagree here). For us that means that from a change\nto a hot-reload in the console it is only a few seconds, instead of more than two minutes. And it doesn't silently break\nthe console when doing a dependency upgrade on the tool.\nThat will also allow us to improve the developer experience on the web console, and we should see some nice improvements\nand fixes in our console, in the next releases.\nMQTT over websocket\nWe had MQTT, even 3.1.1 and 5. What was missing, was MQTT over web sockets. Thanks to\nntex, that is now fixed! You can directly send data over MQTT/WS from your browser.\nBut you can also use MQTT over websocket to connect to the integration endpoint, and consume data from Drogue Cloud.\nYou could do that before too, using the web socket integration, but it wasn't a huge effort, and fans of MQTT might\nactually like this.\nMQTT dialects\nDrogue Cloud is not a general purpose MQTT broker. However, we do offer an API on top of MQTT to interact with\nDrogue Cloud. That is pretty straight forward. But still, some definitions on how do use MQTT exist. We always had the\nplan to extend this, and allow for other APIs and opinions, but didn't have any reason to do so.\nUntil we got approached by a member of the community, asking for a different topic pattern than what Drogue Cloud\ncurrently offers. After a bit of discussion, we even got a PR, implementing part of the change. Many thanks to Julian\nfrom pragmatic minds for pursuing this.\nSo in Drogue Cloud 0.9, it is now possible to configure the MQTT dialect on a per-application level, and override it on\na per-device level. Right now, we have two dialects: the original, Drogue Cloud one. And a \"plain topic one\". Not too\nmuch of a difference, but that is what made sense to Julian.\nEvent processing\nWhen events flow into the system, it sometimes makes sense to do some early processing. For the Ditto integration\nfor example, we had to replace the content type, to identify Ditto protocol payload. As you can't explicitly provide\na \"content type\" with MQTT 3.1.1, we needed an alternative.\nWe also wanted to classify values with an AI/ML model, directly when consuming events from devices. So that the\nconsuming application have some AI/ML enriched data.\nWith Drogue Cloud 0.9, it is now possible to define some inbound rules, which allow stateless processing of events as\nthey come in. And just to be clear, that isn't a complex rule based engine, but an opinionated, lightweight feature\nOne might ask why it makes sense to have this as part of Drogue Cloud? Why not add something like Camel or Drools?\nOr send everything to an external endpoint? The answer is simple: We only support extremely lightweight operations!\nLike changing a header value. So it doesn't make sense to spin up a pod just for that. And by limiting the operations\nwe support, we can ensure that no one is mining bitcoins on our infrastructure.\nAnd if that isn't enough for your use case, then we do support handing off that operation to an external endpoint which\nyou can provide. Using Camel or Knative with that is definitely an option. Here are the operations we currently\nsupport as part of Drogue Cloud:\n\nActivate based on conditions, like cloud event attributes\nModifying cloud event attributes\nContacting an external endpoint to validate the event\nContacting an external endpoint to enrich/modify the event\n\nThere are a lot more operations we could add. But again, we don't want to re-invent anything like Camel. However, if it\nis super lightweight, doesn't include user code, and might be useful for a lot of people, we could definitely add it.\nOut-of-the-box Knative event source\nEvents that come in to Drogue Cloud can be consumed out of Drogue Cloud directly using Kafka, or via the MQTT and\nWebSocket integration. All of those interfaces are consumer initiated variants. The reason for that is simple, as long\nas no one is interested in consuming the data, no processing is performed and no resources are consumed in the cloud\nside. Once a consumer is interested, it will establish a connection to Drogue Cloud, and starts to consume the data.\nHowever, when you want to create a serverless processing of data, that model doesn't work well. Assuming you have a\nKnative serving endpoint, which waits for IoT to be sent, a model which has to initiate the communication doesn't work.\nThe idea of Knative serving is to scale down to zero if no data is being sent, and scale up as required to be able\nto handle all requests.\nWith Drogue Cloud 0.9 we added a producer side initiate model. You can configure a Drogue Cloud application to try and\ndeliver messages from the event stream to a Knative serving endpoint. It doesn't need to be run by Knative, it simply\nis an HTTP, which will receive Cloud Events from Drogue Cloud. Once configured, Drogue Cloud will spin up a pod and\nstart delivering data to the endpoint you provided. Thanks to Rust, this only requires a few MiB of RAM on our side.\nWhat's next?\nWith all the new features, we definitely want to create some more workshops to show you how it works. We are already\nworking on something that leverages the Knative event source. That might be really cool.\nHaving upgraded Yew and streamlined the web development workflow, the console will also receive a bit more attention.\nThere is a lot more we could do, we know that.\nHaving metrics and tracing available, we already did take a quick look at scale testing. This is definitely something\nthat we want to focus on more in this year, but also the first impression was quite encouraging. But we also know that\nwe could add much more detail to metrics and tracing. Like the epic of digital twins, this item will stay on our focus\nfor a while longer.\nI do hope that sanity prevails, and that we can look forward to a much brighter summer release. Stay safe!\nAlso see\n\nReleases\nPublic sandbox\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-nine/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.9.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-seven/":{"body":"The 0.7 release cycle ran through summer and with that, two things happened: people got on vacation, and\nGoogle Summer of Code was going on. So instead of forcing out a release, we decided to just wait and release at a later\ntime. By the way, a decision we discussed during our open community calls: come and join!\nKafka topic provisioning\nWe wanted to split up the Kafka topics for quite a while now. This release, we finally did it! Each application has\nits own event topic now. Yes, that means that command &amp; control still only has a single topic, but we are getting there.\nUsing Strimzi under the hood, we already have an operator which can take care of creating Kafka topics, users, and\naccess roles. So we improved our device registry operator capabilities a bit, and created a (Strimzi) \"topic operator\",\nwhich requests Kafka resources from Strimzi, tracks their state, and syncs that with our device registry.\nThe standard operator can also be replaced, to provision Kafka topics in a different way, should you need that. But\nright now, Strimzi is the default implementation for this.\nWhat do you get from that? Each time you create a new application, a Kafka topic will be provisioned, a user created, and\nwith that, you have direct access to the Kafka topic with your application. Of course, you can also still use the MQTT\nintegration. But wait, there is more …\nWebSocket integration\nGetting data out of Drogue Cloud using MQTT is great. But sometimes WebSockets are just easier to use. And so we\ncreated a WebSockets implementation that allows you to stream events. The payload format is of course using Cloud Events again.\nWe have a nice blog post, explaining how to use the WebSocket integration too.\nAnd while using a tool like websocat is trivial, drg stream can make it even simpler, taking care of endpoints and\nauthentication.\nCoAP endpoint\nImplementing a CoAP endpoint was the Google Summer of Code project from Pranav. And although he had to learn lots of new\nthings, and faced some technical difficulties in addition to the overall complicated situation, he did an amazing job!\nIncluding end-to-end testing! Well done!\nIf you are interested in reading more about his GSoC experience, I recommend reading his GSoC report.\nOne thing that is missing, but that was not a requirement of the project, is the support for DTLS. This is an\nimportant part but is planned to be added in the future. If you are interested, just let us or Pranav know.\nTrust anchor management\nAnother Google Summer of Code project was adding device trust anchor management by Vedang, for drg, our command-line tool. This enables you to manage device trust\nanchors, in the device registry, using a few simple commands.\nWe have a nice blog post on using X.509 client certificates with drogue-cloud,\nshowing a few examples of the new functionality. And there is also a summary post on GSoC phase 1 from Vedang on how own blog.\nImproved deployment and updated dependencies\nA lot of improvements have been made on deploying Drogue Cloud. The Helm Charts are more matured and provide more\nknobs to tweak the deployment. Dependencies have been updated, which brings you Keycloak 15, Strimzi 0.25, and more.\nAs we now have dedicated Kafka topics, we could also improve the deployment of the standard example. It is still\ndeployed by default when using the script, but total optional and externally installable when using the Helm Charts\ndirectly.\nSo you can just install the standard example application on your own cluster, connecting it to the Drogue Cloud\nsandbox installation.\nSwitch to TimescaleDB\nUpdating dependencies as a task for Drogue Cloud 0.7. And when we tried to upgrade InfluxDB, which we used as an\nexample so far, we ran into some real blockers. It turned out, it was easier to migrate from InfluxDB to TimescaleDB\nthan from InfluxDB 1 to 2. Also thanks to Outflux, a great tool should you feel the same\npain.\nWith a few commands, we were able to migrate all our sandbox data to TimescaleDB. Recording it there from now on.\nThis also led to a new version of the pusher: the drogue-postgres-pusher\nis a simple Knative image, which extracts data from Cloud Events, and pushes it to PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB.\nWhat's next\nWe got a nice and stable foundation now when it comes to IoT connectivity. There is always more you can add, and\nwe will. But for the next release of Drogue Cloud, we want to focus on polishing what we already have. This includes\nsupport for metrics and tracing but also making it easier to integrate with existing solutions.\nAs Drogue Cloud is a platform to build your applications on, we will be creating more examples and tutorials to showcase\nwhat is possible. A WiFi example in combination with Drogue Device is in the making. And we will also continue\nworking on the new Eclipse IoT \"Telemetry end-to-end\" package,\nwhich makes use of Drogue Cloud too. But also shows how to integrate other, existing IoT projects\nlike Eclipse Kura and Eclipse Ditto.\nAs always, you are welcome to join and give the new version a try on our sandbox.\nOh, and we do have a proper landing page now!\nAlso see\n\nReleases\nPublic sandbox\nPranav's GSoC report\nVedang's blog\ndrg (Drogue Cloud command line tool)\nPostgreSQL/TimescaleDB pusher\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-seven/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.7.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-six/":{"body":"Drogue Cloud 0.6.0 ran a bit late. But, it is ready when it is ready! This time, the focus was more on improving on what we already have. And taking a look back, we improved a lot.\nFor the impatient\nIn this release we focused on improving existing functionality:\n\nAdded automated, end-to-end testing\nSwitched from Kustomize to Helm, dropping many of the shell based pre-/post-processing\nDirectly connect to Kafka\nFiner grained access control, a public data stream, and a new workshop based on Quarkus and MQTT\nSuccessfully tested running on GKE\nSupport for viewing and editing of applications and devices in the web console\nAggregated API endpoint, switch to Kubernetes Ingress for services\nBug fixes and performance improvements\n\nImproved Testing\nTesting isn't an easy topic if you want to do it right. And while other programming languages have a head start on this,\nRust, being a fairly new language, has a bit of catching up to do.\nIn Drogue Cloud we already have some unit tests and a few more tests, testing complete services. But so far, we did not\nhave any complete, end-to-end system tests. That has now changed.\nThe goal was that we have some testing pipeline, which performs a complete test run, with a released or pre-released\nversion of Drogue Cloud. Spin up a Kubernetes cluster, deploy Drogue Cloud, install drg and run some tests against\nthat installation. Including testing the web UI. And of course, we wanted to stick to the programming language we\nlove: Rust.\nIn the drogue-iot/drogue-cloud-testing repository, you will now\nfind a test suite, which takes care of that. This is an on-demand process where we can request a test run and validate\na packaged installer. And while we are using GitHub actions to orchestrate that, we use external compute resources to\nhave the resources we need.\nAs you can imagine, it is worth the effort, but it also took a bit more time than expected.\nHelm charts and GitOps\nWe started out using YAML files to get Drogue Cloud deployed. When we needed a bit more flexibility, we switched to\nKustomize. Still, we found out that we need even more flexibility. We wanted to have the ability to turn certain\nfeatures on or off. Swap out the container registry with a single setting, replace the provided Postgres or Kafka\ninstance with an existing, external one. All of this is pretty simple when using Helm.\nWhy didn't we pick Helm in the beginning? Well, creating Helm charts comes with a bit of complexity. Plain YAML files\nare much simpler. In Drogue Cloud we try to start simple and adopt more complex technologies when we see a benefit.\nLike in this case, we figured out that we grew out of the plain YAML files and Kustomize, and so we moved on.\nAnd with the migration to Helm Charts, we could also drop a good portion of our accompanying shell scripts, tweaking\nthings after applying the deployment. This finally allows us to perform a more GitOps style approach when deploying\nDrogue Cloud. The sandbox we are operating is now being deployed using ArgoCD. With that, we can always check the state\nof the deployment. See if it is out of sync and what will change when we reconcile.\nFor the shell script installer, that still exists. It is a bit fancier than before and uses Helm in the background. But\nyou can still deploy Drogue Cloud with a single command to your cluster:\n\nDirect Kafka interface\nWe still think that Knative eventing is a great tool to easily wire up event streams and services. And still, in the\nDrogue Cloud infrastructure, we have a few use cases, which are not covered by Knative eventing. And which seems to be\nout of scope too.\nOne example is our MQTT integration service. When a user connects to that service and starts a new subscription, events\nwill flow to that connection. This type of setup is a more \"on-demand\" or \"pull model\" style of receiving events. The\ndecision that events should flow to that consumer is not made by Drogue Cloud, but by the user connecting to that\nservice. This is a model which Knative eventing doesn't support, but we think it is crucial for an IoT-as-a-service\nsolution.\nDoes that mean we gave up on Knative eventing? Absolutely not! Cloud Events, which is the event specification used by\nKnative Eventing, is still at the core of Drogue Cloud. We also use Knative Eventing on the application-side, to\nprocess, transform, and consume events. So with that, you can still use for example a\nKafkaSource to have messages flow towards your Knative\nservice.\nWith the combination of the more flexible Helm charts, this now also allows one to use an externally managed Kafka\ninstance, like Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka.\nFiner grained access control, public data stream, Quarkus MQTT workshop\nWe already added API tokens in 0.5.0, so that you can easily give applications access to Drogue Cloud. In 0.6.0 we\nexpanded access control in a different direction. Beside having the ability to transfer ownership of an application,\nyou can now assign a list of members and assign a role for each member. Roles include reading, modifying, or\nadministrating an application and its resources. Basically, you can grant access to an application to others,\nincluding the \"anonymous user\".\nAnd with that, we can realize a public stream of data. If you have used Drogue Cloud before, you might recall the\ntemperature example that we use as an example. We spiced this up a little bit, deployed this on the sandbox, and made\nthe application readable to anonymous users.\nFor one, you can simply get the stream using the following command:\nmqtt sub --topic app/drogue-public-temperature --host mqtt-integration.sandbox.drogue.cloud --port 443 -s\n\nThis also allowed us to create a second workshop in our \"book\". The workshop uses Quarkus and\nMicroProfile to consume data from the MQTT integration and to implement a web dashboard, showing the temperature and its\ngeo-location on a map.\nUsing the sandbox and the public data stream, you don't need to deploy Drogue Cloud yourself. You can start right\naway, focussing on the cloud side of things. Either using our quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter, or with a more guided approach through our workshop.\nCurious what this looks like? Take a peek:\n\nOr take a look at the running version of this application: https://quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter-drogue-quarkus-demos.apps.wonderful.iot-playground.org/\nBut wait, there is more …\nWe provide out of the box support for Minikube, Kind, and OpenShift. However, we want to ensure that Drogue Cloud runs\non all Kubernetes distributions. So a long-standing goal was to actually test this, and fix issues that would\nprevent us from doing so. For 0.6.0 we have successfully tested running on top of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).\nAll services are now exported through an aggregated API endpoint. The device registry can now handle hashed passwords.\nSwitch to Kubernetes Ingress for console and API endpoints. Fix up a lot of labels for different Kubernetes resources.\nThe web console has a bunch of new pages, mainly around applications and devices. It is now possible to view some\ninformation in a structured form. And additionally, you can also edit the YAML directly from the web console.\n\nWhat's next\nThe Kafka interface layer still needs to handle the one-topic-per-application model. However, cleaning up the Kafka\ninterface felt more important, and so we postponed this task for the 0.7.0 release.\nWe want to add some additional IoT specific endpoints. Making Drogue Cloud more compatible with other systems, and\nallowing to leverage existing APIs sounds like the good idea. Our plan is to take a look at some existing open source\nAPIs, and try to add them. Eclipse Hono and FIWARE come to our mind.\nImproving the developer experience even more is also on our list. For example, providing edge-side SDKs in languages\nlike Python. Creating some more examples and workshops using Kafka and Knative. Maybe in combination with\nQuarkus and Funqy.\nRunning on GKE is fine, but we also want to test Drogue Cloud on Azure, AWS, and others. If you have an interest in\nthis too, feel free to join this effort.\nWe also labeled some issues now with help wanted. Just in case you are looking for a way to contribute. \nAs always, you are welcome to join and give the new version a try on our sandbox.\nAlso see\n\nReleases\nDrogue Cloud Testing\nPublic sandbox\nQuarkus MQTT integration starter\nQuarkus MQTT integration workshop\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-six/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.6.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-ten/":{"body":"For this release, we had a focus on improving existing functionality. Mostly extending what was already there, but\nlacked a few features, knobs to tweak, or as postponed in previous releases. And yes, we fixed a few bugs too. \nMQTT improvements\nMQTT received a few major improvements. One of them is the support for QoS 1, which now works with the MQTT integration,\ndown to Kafka.\nOn the device side, we extended the MQTT endpoint to track the device connection state across MQTT endpoints. By\nintroducing a device state service, we can now handle connection stealing and connection events properly. This gives\nyou the information when devices connect and disconnect through the normal Kafka channel. This even works when pods\ngo down.\nEvents\nIn combination with the new connection events, added device registry change events to the data stream. This will give\nyou change events from the device registry for devices, coming through the regular data stream in Kafka. And with that\nalso using MQTT and WebSockets.\nFor this we added two new event types, so that you can filter and process them accordingly.\nThis allows you to build custom integrations, reconciling with external systems, without being part of the Drogue Cloud\ninfrastructure yourself.\nThe S in IoT\nThere is always something to improve when it comes to security. For example the OAuth2 token, which can be used to\nauthenticate the user on the WebSockets integration. So far, we validated them during the connection establishment phase,\nbut those tokens normally do have an expiration time. Once that passed, the token is no longer valid. For protocols like\nHTTP this is simple, as the token is sent with every request. But for connection oriented protocols, like WebSockets,\nthe question is: what should be done once the token expired.\nWell, starting with this release, we do close the connection. Sounds a bit dramatic? Well, you should have some logic\nin place anyway, which re-opens the connection. However, in order to avoid that, we also added the ability to send\na message to the server side, sending a refreshed token. As long as that is valid, the connection will stay open. Of\ncourse, you can also use access tokens, issues by Drogue Cloud.\nWe also enabled all internal services to work with TLS. You can argue that internal services don't need that, and that\nissues tons of certificates can be a hassle. However, using e.g. the OpenShift service CA, this become pretty easy and\nautomated. So why not leverage that, and allow for custom certificates in addition. Yes, you still can use unencrypted\nconnections too.\nFirmware management for Drogue Device\nIn Drogue Device, we have the ability for flash a new firmware, even while the device is running. This is great, but\nyou also need some way to actually deliver updates like that. For this we created a firmware update service, which\nis based on the infrastructure that Drogue Cloud provides. It can actually be seen as one of those \"custom application\",\nwhich makes use of the infrastructure, to connect some application to its devices.\nHowever, in this case, it feels a bit less custom and much more generic. So we decided to give it its own place:\ndrogue-ajour.\nDrogue Ajour is a service, which defines an update protocol, and provides ready-to-use implementations for\nDrogue Device. But of course it can be used with other frameworks as well. It also interfaces with existing sources\nfor updates, like the Open Container Initiative (OCI) or\nEclipse hawkBit. And using Drogue Cloud as foundation, it can be used over all\nthe protocols which Drogue Cloud supports, like MQTT, HTTP, or even LoRaWAN.\nWe will tell you more about Ajour in a future blog post, but just to get you excited: Think about creating a\nTekton build pipeline, uploading your firmware blob to a container\nregistry (like Quay or GHCR) and have it delivered to your devices. Tracking\nthe progress along the way:\n\n\nAnd of course, with the hawkBit integration, you can do the scheduling through the external system. \nExploring the edge\nWe also did an early proof-of-concept with Open Cluster Management. We created an\naddon, which allows to bridge Drogue Cloud with OCM, syncing device workload to the edge, using Kubernetes resources.\nTrue, this is in a very early state. But check it out, if you are\nfeeling adventurous.\nSo in the future, you might be able to just \"configure OPC UA\" for a device, and this will spin up the OPC UA bridge,\non the device, to deliver data right to your data channel.\nWait, there is more\nWe migrated to the newest Keycloak version, which is now based on Quarkus, consuming less resources, and brining a new\noperator at the same time. That was a pretty complex migration, but we are glad that we are on the bleeding edge of\nKeycloak again. Future upgrade should be much easier now.\nOf course, we also upgraded a lot of dependencies, and Rust, but also our base container images. These are now based\non UBI9/RHEL 9.\nThere are also our Helm charts. We are operating our public sandbox for over a year\nnow. Deploying it for around a year now using Helm and ArgoCD, in a GitOps style. And it works great.\nHowever, we also found out that we are missing lots of knows and abilities to tweak the deployment. So we did add a lot\nof new knobs, that can help you tweak the deployment using the existing charts. While at the same time, restructuring\nthe charts to reduce their complexity. To be honest, this is an ongoing process, but it also is a huge improvement in\nthis release.\nThe drg command line tool also received a major overhaul. Re-using the existing client library, and bringing a new\ncommands in the process. It also supports machine-readable output through JSON now, so that you can start writing shell\nscripts working with the Drogue Cloud system.\nWhat's next\nYou might have noticed, the topic of digital twin was missing in this release. This is still on our roadmap! However,\nto be honest, we aren't fully sure in which direction to head with this. So, it will simply take a bit longer than\nexpected. But we want to get it right. However, we progressed a bit with the proof-of-concept, encrypting IoT payload\nend-to-end (device to digital twin), might be worth taking a look.\nA point to focus on will also be our documentation. Drogue Cloud can do a lot more than we advertise, and we need to\nchange this. This might also include some more workshops, but definitely the documentation needs to be enhanced, to\nexplain what is already available.\nWe will definitely continue with our edge integration efforts. Alongside Open Cluster Management, which is intended, as\nthe name says, for clusters, we also want to explore the use of Project Flotta. Flotta\nis designed for small footprint devices on the edge, which might be quite a good fit for IoT workloads on the edge.\nAlso see\n\nReleases\nPublic sandbox\n\nFirmware management\n\n\nDrogue Ajour\nDrogue IoT OPC UA agent\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-ten/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.10.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-rebase/":{"body":"For the past few weeks, we explored removing the allocator from drogue-device and adapt drivers to a more restrictive Actor model. Read on to learn why and how drogue device will change, and the benefits of this change.\nBackground\nAfter the initial announcement of drogue-device, we've expanded the set of drivers that cover WiFi and LoRa, and have demonstrated that drogue-device can talk to drogue-cloud. The actor model as improved after feedback from the Rust community, and we think that writing firmware composed of Actors is a nice way to program. \nAt the same time, we sometimes touched on a issues related to memory management and missing async features in Rust, so we felt that the time was right to evaluate our approach so far and look at some of the challenges:\n\nAlthough Rust async is great, there are some features that makes async harder on embedded.\nThe actor model allows implementing handlers for arbitrary messages for an actor. This flexibility of the current actor model requires a static allocator, and in turn prevents knowing memory usage of an application upfront.\nA driver package could end up using 2-3 actors, thereby significantly increasing the memory footprint of an application, causing issues when doing encryption and things that have a high peak memory use.\nWith a goal of developing a bootloader and supporting firmware updates from drogue-cloud, and working with TLS, we needed to reduce the footprint.\n\nFor the past few weeks, we have been working on a way to remove the static allocator from drogue-device, and re-use the ongoing async embedded effort driven by the community.\nBut first, lets have a look at what a simple drogue-device application with a single \"counter actor\" looks like today:\nstruct CounterActor {\n    counter: u32\n}\n\nstruct Increment;\nstruct GetCount;\n\n\nimpl Actor for CounterActor {\n    type Configuration = ();\n    fn on_start(self) -&gt; Completion&lt;Self&gt; {\n        Completion::defer(async move {\n            self.counter = 0;\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nimpl NotifyHandler&lt;Increment&gt; for CounterActor {\n    fn on_notify(mut self, message: Increment) -&gt; Completion&lt;Self&gt; {\n        Completion::defer(async move {\n            self.counter += 1;\n            self\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nimpl RequestHandler&lt;GetCount&gt; for CounterActor {\n    type Response = u32;\n    fn on_request(mut self, message: GetCount) -&gt; Response&lt;Self::Response&gt; {\n        Request::defer(async move {\n            (self, self.counter)\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nstruct MyDevice {\n    counter: ActorContext&lt;CounterActor&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl Device for MyDevice {\n    fn mount(&amp;'static self, _: DeviceConfiguration&lt;Self&gt;, supervisor: &amp;mut Supervisor) {\n        let address = self.counter.mount((), supervisor);\n        address.notify(Increment);\n        // Pass address of to some other actor\n    }\n}\n\nfn configure() -&gt; MyDevice {\n    MyDevice {\n        counter: ActorContext::new(CounterActor{ counter: 0 });\n    }\n}\n\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    device!(MyDevice = configure; 1024);\n}\n\nTo keep the example small, additional actors that use the counter are left out. \nAt the core is the Device, which holds on to a set of actors. An actor implements the Actor trait, and for every message type it handles, it implements a NotifyHandler or a RequestHandler. Messages are sent using an Address handle, that is produced when mounting an actor.\nFor further introductions to drogue-device, have a look at our book.\nSo, lets talk about the problems and how that impacts the framework.\nProblem 1: what type of message can an Actor handle?\nIn drogue-device, an actor may handle different types of messages. To handle a new message type, a RequestHandler or NotifyHandler trait implementation for the message type is written.\nEach actor in drogue-device is accompanied by a ActorContext, which owns the Actor and, amongst other things, a queue for the incoming messages.\nWhat type is the element in the queue? Because an Actor can have a RequestHandler implemented for any Rust type, it can be any type! Therefore, we cannot know at compile time the size of the queue. In practice this means that the message must be stored on a heap, so alloc and Box must be used in order to get a fixed size element.\nSolution:\nTo avoid alloc, the ActorContext must know the type of messages beforehand. This requires putting some restrictions on an Actor: it must only handle messages of a single type. So, instead of writing a RequestHandler for different message types, the Actor trait tself defines an associated type Message, which the implementor uses to specify the message type. In addition, the message handler function signature for that type is part of the Actor trait.\nIn short, instead of this:\ntrait Actor { }\n\ntrait RequestHandler&lt;M&gt; {\n    fn on_request(&amp;self, message: M);\n}\n\nThe RequestHandler trait is removed, and the Actor trait is modified to this:\ntrait Actor {\n    type Message;\n    fn on_message(&amp;self, message: Self::Message);\n}\n\nBut, all is not lost: To handle multiple message types, an enum can be used, and the implementation can use pattern matching to perform the appropriate action. The end result is that the size of incoming message queue is known at compile time, yay!\nProblem 2: what is the size of an async function?\nThe second problem was more difficult, and relates to how async-await works in Rust. So, first a little side-track.\nFutures in Rust\nThe async-await syntax is quite compact:\nasync fn double_it(arg: u32) -&gt; u32 {\n    arg * 2\n}\n\nThis function gets translated to a 'unit of code' that can be executed (polled) later, aka. a Future. The way Rust does that is to generate a type that implements the Future trait. The future trait has a method that allows you to poll the future, which will drive it to completion, or allow you to register a Waker used to signal the runtime that the future can be polled again.\nTo run the future, a runtime also called an  executor is used, and there are several of those out there. Drogue-device has had its own executor that runs actors, and each actor may have one \"current\" future that can be polled. The implementation simply iterates over all the actors, ask them if they have any futures stored that it should poll, and then polls them. \nThere are many resources on this topic, such as the async book, or this excellent blog post on pin and suffering.\nBack to the problem\nWell, the problem relates to the size of a future. When drogue device calls an Actors RequestHandlerfor a given message, the RequestHandler returns a Future! However, the size of that Future depends on the code within it (so, it can know how much stack memory is needed by code).\nIf you want to store a future (on the ActorContext) to be polled at some later point by the executor, how do you do that? By using alloc and putting the future in a Box!\nIn drogue device this can be seen in the signature of RequestHandler, which returns a Response. What this does behind the scene is to use alloc and store the future in a Box so that it can be stored on the ActorContext. \nSolution:\nTo resolve this we need to constrain the Actor even more: For each Actor implementation, we must know the size of the future it returns. This, in turn, means that it can only return a \"known\" future that the compiler can understand the size of.\nIn rust stable, this means that all actors have to return something that implements the Future trait, and that just makes writing Actors too hard.\nThe ideal feature needed to handle this is really \"Async Traits\" - being able to define async functions in traits (the Actor trait) and then have the compiler magically figure out which implementation is used and calculate the known size. \nUnfortunately, this will not come to Rust for some time. In Rust nightly, however, there are a few compiler features we can enable, that gives us the ability to use nice async {} blocks in the Actor implementations:\n#![feature(min_type_alias_impl_trait)]\n#![feature(impl_trait_in_bindings)]\n#![feature(generic_associated_types)]\n#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]\n\nCombined, these allow us to use associated types in traits with lifetimes, in combination with impl Future as a type. \nTo sum it up, instead of defining the trait like this and requiring alloc:\ntrait Actor {\n    fn do_something(&amp;self) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Future&gt;;\n}\n\nOne can do this instead:\ntrait Actor {\n    type TheFuture&lt;'m&gt;: Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'm;\n    fn do_something&lt;'m&gt;(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::TheFuture&lt;'m&gt;;\n}\n\nAnd the resulting implementation can look like this:\nimpl Actor for MyActor {\n    type TheFuture&lt;'m&gt; = impl Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'm;\n    fn do_something&lt;'m&gt;(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::TheFuture&lt;'m&gt; {\n        async move {\n            // Do some cool async-await stuff!\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nOk, so thats not too bad. It's still a bit away from fully async traits, but it will have to do.\nDrogue-device reborn\nWith these things sorted out, we are able to remove the static allocator, at the cost of requiring Rust nightly features. \nAnother project doing async rust embedded that were already going for Rust nightly was the Embassy Project. \nIf we were anyway going to use nightly, what if we reused the executor and HAL from Embassy?\nEmbassy\nEmbassy is a project to make async/await a first-class option for embedded development. All the way from the Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL), to the executor and running tasks. \nAll interaction with peripherals can be done using async-await, which is a great model to work with when dealing with timers, interrupts and so on. One can write code like the following to wait for an interrupt with a timeout:\nlet interrupt_fut = self.irq.wait_for_rising_edge();\nlet timeout_fut = Timer::after(timeout);\n\nmatch select(interrupt_fut, timeout_fut).await {\n    Either::Left((r, _)) =&gt; // Handle interrupt\n    Either::Right(_) =&gt; // Handle timeout\n}\n\nAfter playing around with Embassy and, we decided that using embassy as the foundation of our acter model was a viable approach.\nDrogue-device rebased\nHaving modified drogue-device actor model and rebased it on embassy, we see the following improvements:\n\nFlash usage reduced by 2x\nStatic RAM usage reduced by ~7x\n\nWe also have good reasons to believe stack usage is somewhat reduced by only using Actors for the cases where shared access to some resource, or the ease of composition is desired.\nThere are additional benefits like running drogue-device the host, which can simplify driver development.\nSo what does it look like?\nSo, lets take a look at what the example at the beginning of this post will look like when rewritten to the new world:\nstruct CounterActor {\n    counter: u32\n}\n\nenum CounterRequest {\n    Increment,\n    GetCount(u32),\n}\n\nimpl Actor for CounterActor {\n    type Configuration = ();\n    type Message&lt;'m&gt; = CounterRequest;\n\n    type StartFuture&lt;'m&gt; = impl Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'm;\n    fn on_start&lt;'m&gt;(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Self::StartFuture&lt;'m&gt; {\n        async move {\n            self.counter = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    type MessageFuture&lt;'m&gt; = impl Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'm;\n    fn on_message(&amp;mut self, message: Self::Message&lt;'m&gt;) -&gt; Self::MessageFuture&lt;'m&gt; {\n        async move {\n            match message {\n                CounterRequest::Increment =&gt; self.counter += 1,\n                CounterRequest::GetCount(c) =&gt; *c = self.counter,\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n#[derive(Device)]\nstruct MyDevice {\n    counter: ActorContext&lt;'static, CounterActor&gt;,\n}\n\n#[drogue::main]\nasync fn main(mut context: DeviceContext&lt;MyDevice&gt;) {\n    context.configure(MyDevice {\n        counter: ActorContext::new(CounterActor { counter: 0 }),\n    });\n    \n    let address = context.mount(|device| {\n        device.counter.mount(())\n    });\n    address.notify(CounterRequest::Increment).await;\n}\n\nNotice that the main function is now fully async, which in turn simplifies the rest of the work around configuring the device, mounting the actors and from then using the addresses to send messages to actors.\nYou can also see the restrictions imposed in order to allow zero alloc: a single message type per actor, and using associated types to define the futures that are returned by the actor.\nUnit testing is also simplified:\n#[drogue::test]\nasync fn mytest(context: TestContext&lt;MyDevice&gt;) {\n    // Do the stuff you'd normally do in main + assertions\n}\n\nThe TestContext has the same API as the DeviceContext, extended with methods to create async signals, dummy pins and a controlled shutdown of the test.\nWhats next?\nAt the time of writing, all the work is done in a separate repository, with the goal of replacing the existing drogue-device repository once most of the remaining drivers and examples have been moved over. If you want to contribute to this effort, reach out in the drogue iot chat.\nSummary\nFor the past few weeks, we explored removing the static allocator from drogue-device and adapt drivers to a more restrictive Actor model. After several attempts, we could not find a way to do this without starting to use features from Rust nightly. Having moved to nightly, the barrier for adopting an existing framework like embassy as the foundation was lower. And the outcome have been all positive. The Embassy project have been very helpful in answering questions, discussing our problems and reviewing patches that we've submitted.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-rebase/","title":"Rebasing Drogue Device"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-to-cloud/":{"body":"In previous posts we've seen how to run drogue-cloud, how to use LoRaWAN in rust, and the introduction of the drogue-device. In this post, we'll tie this together and walk through the process of running LoRa on drogue-device, sending data to drogue-cloud. \nRecap\nLet's have a quick look at the different technologies we will be focusing on in this post.\nLoRa\nLoRa is a low power long range wireless protocol that operates in a lower frequency spectrum than WiFi, ZigBee and Bluetooth. This enables IoT use cases not possible with the shorter range technologies. We've previously seen how you can use LoRa with Rust. In this post, LoRa is only used as an example of one way to communicate from a drogue-device to drouge-cloud. We aim to support both WiFi, LoRa, NB-IoT and other wireless standards for working with drogue-cloud.\nDrogue Device\nDrogue Device is an Actor framework for writing embedded applications in Rust. The advantage of using drogue-device is that you can represent sensors and peripherals as independent components (actors) and wire them together in your application, as a way to apply good software engineering principles in embedded programming.\nDrogue Cloud\nIn many cases you might want to connect your devices to some central system. A system that may receive data, hand\nout commands and configuration to devices, orchestrate firmware updates and lots more. That is Drogue Cloud, our backend\nsystem based on Kubernetes, Knative, and Cloud Events.\nDrogue Cloud provides you with tools for device authentication and authorization,\ndifferent protocol endpoints, message normalization, persistence, device management, and a few more things. The idea is\nthat, on the cloud side, you can focus on processing the data that your devices provide you.\nDevice drivers\nDrogue-device contains device drivers for different boards and sensors. Drivers follow a common set of patterns that makes it easier to write new drivers. Device drivers can be written in different ways, but the common approach is to implement the following:\n\nAn API that defines the API that a class of drivers implement. This may already exist (Examples are SPI and UART). This is located in src/api/.\nA driver that implements an API, either using a HAL or hardware directly. This is located in src/driver.\n(Optional) A HAL (Hardware Access Layer) for internal traits and types that a driver can use to support different hardware. This is located in src/hal.\n(Optional) Hardware-specific code that may implement a HAL. This is located in src/port/&lt;device class&gt;.\n\nA driver is exposed as a Package that can be configured during application initialization. The Package exposes an Actor that can be used to interact with the driver.\nFor more information on writing drivers, see the driver guide.\nIn this example, we'll be using the Rak811 driver that implements the LoRa driver API, and the DMA UART driver that implements the UART API. These are independent drivers, that are wired together using message passing. All interactions with the peripheral is done using the drivers address that is configured during device initialization.\nThere are also drivers for eS-WiFi and SPI based on embedded_hal.\nTo send a message, the LoRa driver address is used:\nlora_driver_address.send(QoS::Confirmed, 1, b\"Hello\").await.expect(\"Error sending data\");\n\nUnder the hood this will send a message to the LoRa driver which will initiate the transfer. Using Rust Async, the result can be await'ed, which in this case is required to ensure that the reference is kept valid for the lifetime of the request.\nThe full example of drogue-device can be found here. You'll see that most of the application consists of defining the drivers to use, and wiring them together in the device event handling.\nTelemetry to the cloud\nWhen the device sends data to the cloud, it actually shouts out its message to the local airspace using the LoRa\nprotocol. If there is a LoRa gateway nearby, then it will take that message and forward that to its backend system.\nIn our case, we chose to use The Things Network (TTN), just because we had a bit of experience with them. And,\nbecause they have a great and affordable indoor gateway and great support for many different types of gateways, which is\ngreat for testing.\nOnce the message reached the backend system of TTN, it will get forwarded to our Drogue Cloud sandbox instance using\nthe HTTP integration of TTN. The following diagram shows the message flow in a bit more detail:\n\nDon't be scared! Yes, this is a bit more complex than just sending your message to the cloud using WiFi. Let's take\na look at the different components in there.\n\nDrogue Device – This is your device, your code and your data you want to transmit.\nLoRa gateway – The LoRa gateway acts as the local entry point for LoRa devices to a TCP/IP network. Depending on\nthe type of gateway, its antenna and location, it can cover quite an area, much larger than any WiFi could do. And, with\nless power requirements for the devices.\nThe Things Network – TTN is a service provider, which takes on pre-processing LoRa messages received by their\ngateways. The good thing, you can put up a gateway yourself and add it to their network. Which also means, that you\ncan re-use other gateways in their system. Another task that LoRa backend systems have to perform, is the detection\nof duplicates. Maybe there are multiple gateways in the vicinity of your device. Which also means that messages will\nalso be received and forwarded by multiple gateways. While this is good for coverage and redundancy, you want to\nfilter out duplicates as some point. TTN provides this service, and also allows to enrich the data with additional\ninformation.\nExporting messages – We don't to process our data, and so we need to get the messages out of TTN. One of the\noptions is to use the HTTP integration of TTN. In a nutshell, this will call a configured HTTP endpoint for each\nmessage received. Ideal for our Drogue IoT HTTP endpoint.\nHTTP endpoint – The Drogue Cloud HTTP endpoint will authenticate and authorize the remote peer. It also\nunderstands the specific API and JSON format of TTN, and converts this into a CloudEvents structure. Forwarding this\nto Knative and Kafka.\nBackend app – Your application, on the cloud side. The application which wants to process the data coming from\nyour devices.\n\nWhy don't we directly consume from TTN? One of the core features of Drogue Cloud is to\nintegrate with all kinds of IoT related communication partners. Just assume you want to add an additional network like\nSigfox later on. Our you want to add some of your own gateways? Or add some devices using MQTT? In all those cases,\nyou would need to create some kind of data normalization layer yourself. If that is a dedicated layer, or a growing\nif/else block in your code, doesn't matter. Drogue cloud provides that layer for you, and lets your application\nconsume all those messages using standardized CloudEvents.\nAnother question is: why don't we directly send to the Drogue Cloud instance? First, we will always need some kind of\ngateway, to bridge between LoRaWAN and the TCP/IP world. We cloud create our own gateway stack, receive messages and\nforward them directly to our endpoints. On the other hand, that would mean that we would need to do the LoRa specific\nprocessing, like detecting duplicates, ourselves. Yes, some open source software exists for that as well. But, in any\ncase, we would need that functionality. For the sake of simplicity, we simply re-use an existing service for this.\nStill, if you are interested in creating a direct integration, we would be happy to help you in the process.\nPreparing drogue-cloud\nSetting up a Drogue Cloud instance should be as easy as:\nminikube start --cpus 4 --memory 16384 --disk-size 20gb --addons ingress\nminikube tunnel # in a separate terminal, as it keeps running\n./hack/drogue.sh\n\nHowever, for connecting to The Things Network, you will need to have a publicly accessible instance, as the HTTP\nintegration of TTN will call into your instance. Setting up a publicly hosted version of Drogue Cloud might be a bit\nmore effort, and maybe something that you would like to avoid in the beginning.\nAs we face the same issue, we have set up a public sandbox for playing around and testing. You are welcome to use it as\nwell, if you promise not to use it in production. It is an in-development version of Drogue Cloud, and it doesn't\nprotect your data in any way! On the other side, it is super easy to get started:\n\nNavigate to: https://console-drogue-iot.apps.wonderful.iot-playground.org/\nLog in using your GitHub account\nCreate a new \"application\" and \"device\"\n\nApplications provide a way to isolate devices. Follow the instructions on the \"getting started\" page to create a new\napplication, and a new device. As application IDs must be unique, and this is a shared instance, be sure to pick a fresh\nID. For device IDs, you are free to pick whatever you want, as long as it is unique for your application.\nThe default command will use the password hey-rodney. Be warned: Don't put in your usual password here, as for now,\neveryone else will be able to see it.\nIntegrating TTN with drogue-cloud\nIn the TTN console, you can create an integration using several out of the box components. For drogue-cloud, we can use the generic HTTP Integration, which allows you to configure TTN to pass on telemetry data to a HTTP endpoint, in our case the Drogue IoT sandbox. The authorization header contains the HTTP basic auth credentials for our device. (NOTE: This is not really a good way of doing things, writing a proper integration that did not require storing credentials in TTN would be better).\n\nOnce the integration is set up, we are ready to send some data.\nSending the data\nTo verify that the end to end is working, Open the Drogue Cloud Sandbox in your browser and go to the 'Spy' page, where you can watch all telemetry being sent (filter by your application id to avoid too much traffic).\nTo send the data, we flash the device using cargo embed. This will open the debug console for the device, so we can see what's going on:\n\nThe example is made for the BBC micro:bit attached to a RAK811 LoRa board over UART. To join the network, we push the A button on the micro:bit. To send data, we push the B button.\nOnce data is sent, the telemetry should find its way to the drogue console:\n\nFuture work\nIn this post we have seen how you can combine Drogue Device with Drogue Cloud using the LoRa protocol. We have seen how you can create applications and devices in Drogue Cloud, configure The Things Network (TTN) to forward data to Drogue Cloud, and used the Drogue Device actor framework for our embedded application.\nWe want to improve the experience of drogue device and drogue cloud even further. Some ideas:\n\nFirmware upgrade of drogue device built and pushed from drogue cloud\nImproved integration with TTN APIs (Use Drogue Cloud device management for everything)\nImprove range of drivers for drogue-device and reduce memory footprint\n\nPlease reach out to us if you have any further ideas or would like to work on the drogue project.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-to-cloud/","title":"From drogue-device to drogue-cloud"},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-wasm/":{"body":"What does embedded development and WebAssembly have in common? Turns out it's quite a lot! Read on to see how Drogue Device can run in your browser.\nWhats new?\nAs discussed earlier, Drogue Device was refactored to integrate with Embassy as its runtime. Since then, we've worked with the Embassy project to improve support for STM32 microcontrollers and as well as other minor improvements and fixes. Drogue Device is more concerned with being an Actor framework, a collection of drivers for IoT use cases (With connectivity such as LoRa, WiFi, and more to come!), integration with Drogue Cloud and having examples for different boards geared towards IoT connectivity.\nOne day, an idea came up to run Drogue Device in the browser. Why would you do that? Well, it's not a primary use case for Drogue Device, but the similarity between Rust in the browser and on embedded is that they both require code to work without the standard library (no_std). Clearly, we could not pass on this opportunity!\nIn this post, we'll give you some references on how to run Rust applications in your browser, and more specifically: you how you can run Drogue Device in a browser, using a button HTML element as input (simulating a ... button!), and a standard text element as output (simulating a LED). For the impatient, the full example can be found here.\nSounds good, how do we do that?\nFirst, to use Rust in the browser, you can use wasm-bindgen. It provides a way to build Rust WebAssembly(Wasm) modules, and to a bidirectional mapping with JavaScript code if you wish. Building a Wasm module can be done using the wasm-pack tool. There are plenty of examples here, and here, with varying degrees of complexity and integration with JavaScript.\nCan browsers do async though?\nYeah, they can! With the wasm-bindgen-futures, one can spawn async tasks in the same way that the Embassy executor can. And in our case, we can invoke the Rust main function as an async function as well!\nTo invoke our Rust main, the following snippet goes in the HTML:\n&lt;script type=\"module\"&gt;\n    import init from './pkg/browser.js';\n\n    async function run() {\n    await init();\n    }\n\n    // This calls the module init which spawns the drogue device\n    run();\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nAnd the corresponding Rust function main function that is invoked on script start is located here\n#[wasm_bindgen(start)]\npub fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), JsValue&gt; {\n    spawn_local(async move {\n        // Code goes here\n    });\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nThe spawn_local is the entry point for spawning async tasks in wasm-bindgen-futures. In our example though, the task spawning will happen within Drogue Device itself, as we will see in a moment.\nWhat about peripherals?\nThere are no physical peripherals in a browser. However, you can think of HTML buttons in the same way as a button in the physical world. You can also modify the state of the world in the browser (the DOM).\nLets use the following HTML elements to represent a button and a LED:\n&lt;button id=\"button\"&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"led\"&gt;OFF&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIn Rust, we need to simulate the peripherals that interacts with these elements:\npub static mut INPUT1: InputPin = InputPin::new();\npub static mut OUTPUT1: OutputPin = OutputPin::new();\n\nAt initialization, the an InputPin and OutputPin can be configured to map to an HTML element. We can do so in our main function:\nunsafe {\n    INPUT1.configure(\"button\");\n    OUTPUT1.configure(\"led\", |value| if value {\"ON\" } else { \"OFF\" });\n}\n\nThese are global mutable variables, so an unsafe block is needed. Since the module load is only called once, it is safe to call configure from here.\nI will not go through the implementation of InputPin and OutputPin, but what you need to know is that the InputPin will bind to the click JavaScript event for a given HTML element (provided by its id attribute). For the OutputPin, it will set a text value for a HTML element based on the output of the provided closure. The implementation of these types can be found in the git repository.\nNow we need some rust types that we can hand to the Button and Led actor types that are provided by Drogue Device. For that, we have created the WebButton and WebLed types, which implements traits from the embedded-hal and embassy crates, which mimic the behavior of their embedded counter-parts.\nlet button = WebButton::new(unsafe { &amp;INPUT1 });\nlet led = WebLed::new(unsafe { &amp;OUTPUT1 });\n\nWiring up Drogue Device\nNow that we have the peripherals implementing the required traits, we can configure drogue device like we would in any embedded application. First, lets define our device type and create the static instance:\nstruct MyDevice {\n    led: ActorContext&lt;'static, Led&lt;WebLed&gt;&gt;,\n    button: ActorContext&lt;'static, Button&lt;'static, WebButton, Led&lt;WebLed&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nstatic DEVICE: DeviceContext&lt;MyDevice&gt; = DeviceContext::new();\n\nIn our main function, we'll initialize the actor for our device with the peripherals:\nDEVICE.configure(MyDevice {\n    led: ActorContext::new(Led::new(led)),\n    button: ActorContext::new(Button::new(button)),\n});\n\nFinally, we need to mount the device. Mounting a device means spawning the per-actor tasks that wait for incoming messages for an actor and runs the processing loop. Since we're running in a browser, we cannot use the Embassy executor, because it will loop forever awaiting actor tasks. Instead, we'll re-use the async spawn capability of wasm-bindgen and implement the ActorSpawner trait, which will enable it to be used when mounting a device:\nlet spawner = WasmSpawner::new();\nDEVICE.mount(|device| {\n    let led = device.led.mount((), spawner);\n    device.button.mount(led, spawner);\n});\n\nAnd thats it! The same actors and framework used in the nRF52, STM32 or rPi Pico examples can be used in WebAssembly! Once example is built and running, the end result looks like this after clicking the button a few times:\n\nYou can even try out this example here.\nWhats next?\nSo, does this mean drogue device has changed focus and will be Web 4.0? Probably not! Instead, consider this an example how drogue-device can be used with any async executor in no_std land, with some minimal glue code attached.\nAn application of running drogue-device in the browser could be to replicate state of an embedded device, like a digital twin in real time. It would require some sort of component library built to mimic the embedded variants, but it would be interesting to see how far that could go.\nIf you have an interesting use case, please reach out to us on github or in our matrix chat.\nSummary\nIn this post we've first presented some new advancements in drogue-device. We then went to show how Rust WebAssembly applications can simulate peripherals from an embedded environment using HTML elements. We then showed how to wire the peripherals into drogue device actors, and launching the drogue device using the browser runtime.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-wasm/","title":"Drogue Device in the browser"},"https://blog.drogue.io/esp-programmer/":{"body":"Getting started with an ESP-01 isn't one of the easiest\nthings. At least if you are not used to embedded systems. It is a nice solution though to add Wi-Fi\ncapabilities to an existing platform.\nThe ESP-01\nI started out with my STM32F723E-DISCOVERY board,\nand choose it simply because it provides a nice set of interfaces. Which is great for testing and, well, discovering.\nWhat it doesn't have, is on-board Wi-Fi, or any other kind of network support. Not ideal if you plan on doing IoT.\nHowever, brings a ready-to-plug ESP-01 port, which is mapped to an internal UART. That port is specifically designed\nfor the ESP-01. It has a matching slot, with the correct pin assignment, the required 3.3V, and maps to UART5 on the\nboard.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nMy naive idea, was to simply plug it in, and \"dial out\" to the internet with some\nAT commands. The\nESP chips provide an out-of-the-box firmware, which offers you a set of \"AT commands\", that control the Wi-Fi and\nTCP/IP stack, which is embedded in the chip. You only need some serial communication, and let the chip handle the more\ncomplex things.\nFirmware updates\nBefore ordering, I already read that the shipped firmware of some ESPs, is most likely extremely old. And indeed,\nthat was the case for me as well. I had hoped for something more recent, but I had no luck.\nPlaying with some NodeMCU like boards, which feature the same ESP8622 chip, I know that you can easily flash a new\nfirmware using the esptool.py from the command line. All you need is a PC and a USB cable. The problem is, the ESP-01\ndoesn't have a USB port. In the case of the NodeMCU, you have an UART interface built into the board, which connects\nthe USB port with the ESP. On the USB host, you simply see it as a UART USB interface.\nAs the ESP-01 requires 3.3V, instead of the 5V that most other UARTs require, you do need to come up with some extra\nwiring. There are a lot of tutorials on the net,\nwhich explain how to flash an ESP-01. I guess, the simplest solution is to buy and FTDI adapter, which supports 3.3V.\nHowever, even that still requires you to come up with a solution for triggering the programming mode of the ESP via\nthe GPIO0 port.\nThe solution\nOn the other side, right on my desk was the discovery board, which has support for the ESP-01 out of the box. It also\nhas an internal \"virtual com port\", which is connected through USB with the host over the ST-LINK port. On the board it\nis known as USART6, and on my Linux machine, it becomes /dev/ttyACM0.\nThe only thing required was a \"proxy\", which bridges the two serial ports. A few lines of Rust later, I came up with\na rather simple loop, which looked something like this:\nloop {\n   if let Ok(c) = rx_esp.read() {\n      to_vcom.push(c);\n   }\n   if let Ok(c) = rx_vcom.read() {\n      to_esp.push(c);\n   }\n   if let Some(to_esp.peek()) {\n      if let Ok(_) = tx_esp.write() {\n         to_esp.poll();\n      }\n   }\n   if let Some(to_vcom.peek()) {\n      if let Ok(_) = tx_vcom.write() {\n         tx_vcom.poll();\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nTo be fair, my code doesn't look as elegant as this. You can take a peek at\nctron/embedded-serial-bridge. However, it isn't too difficult either.\nI think Rust helps you a lot to write readable code, even in the context of embedded devices. \nPlugging in the discovery board now provides a USB serial interface. Depending on the mode I select, the ESP gets\nbooted either in normal mode or in programming mode. In the programming mode, I can use the esptool now to\nflash the ESP-01. Or recover from a bricked device. In normal mode, I can use minicom,\nto play with AT commands. \nLessons learned\nWas that really necessary? It was a good opportunity to learn about embedded and Rust. As mentioned before, I could\nhave bought an FTDI adapter, and try to get away with that. On the other side, building that serial bridge with Rust\nand cargo embed, was quite easy.\nA problem that I faced during development, was that I lost quite a number of characters at some point.\nMy assumption was, that although I did not use DMA and interrupts, the loop should be fast enough to\nprocess a few characters.\nIt took me a while until I figured out, that this was caused by the Rust debug code. The more complex my program got,\nthe more characters I did loose. Building in release mode with cargo embed --release fixed the issue.\nFuture improvements\nMy itch is scratched. On the other side, I am pretty sure I will need to flash some ESP-01 in the future. So maybe\nI will make my own life easier and make use of the user button that the ESP has. It could be used top reset the ESP\nafter flashing. Or switch the modes between programming and normal mode. The LEDs could be use, to show serial traffic,\nor in which mode the system is.\nIt could also be fun, to port this to a different board. Right now the code is specifically written for the STM32F723IE.\nThe Rust build support features, which allow you to do conditional compilation and dependencies. The good thing\nwith Rust's conditional compilation is, that all the guarantees that Rust gives, you are still valid. So it should\nbe possible to allow you to compile for a specific board, like this:\ncargo embed --feature &lt;your board&gt;\n\nAnd maybe, if you have the some problem, this gives you a reason to try it out yourself.\nSee also\n\nGitHub repository — https://github.com/ctron/embedded-serial-bridge\nCargo embed — https://github.com/probe-rs/cargo-embed\nRust/Cargo Features — https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/esp-programmer/","title":"Creating an ESP programmer"},"https://blog.drogue.io/eswifi/":{"body":"There's a lot of variety in the embedded world. \nWhile we've implemented the ESP8266 WiFi-offload board over USART last time, now we're doing the Inventek eS-WiFi over the SPI bus.\nLet's explore some of the differences.\neS-WiFi\nThe reason we're addressing this WiFi-offload board is because it's what ships on the STM B-L4S5I-IOT01A board.\nRadio-related peripherals are often sold as complete units and soldered onto another board, instead of built natively onto the main board from components.\nThis assists with certifications from the FCC and other bodies that care about the signals you're emitting.\n\nAs with the ESP8266, it ostensibly uses Hayes AT commands to communicate.\nUnlike the ESP8266, the eS-WiFi, at least when mounted by STM onto this devboard, uses SPI as it's interface.\nSPI\nSPI is a unique little beast. \nIt's a bus, which allows multiple peripherals to be attached at a time.\nYou may see abbreviations such as MISO and MOSI, but given sensitivity of the underlying words and how they affect others, we're moving to using CIPO and COPI.\nCIPO stands for Controller In, Peripheral Out, which COPI stands for Controller Out, Peripheral In.\nTwo wires; one heads each direction.\nAdditionally, there's a SCK wire, which provides a clock (driven by the controller), so there is no need to agree a-priori on the communication speed.\n(This assumes the peripheral can keep up with the speed set by the controller).\nCompare to USARTs, where both sides have to agree, out-of-band, on the baudrate, etc.\nWith multiple peripherals on the bus, the way each peripheral is given a chance to talk to the controller is through a chip select (CS) pin.\nIn general, the controller dedicates one pin per peripheral. These pins are active low, so that to signal a chip is selected, the pin should be brought down to ground.\nThis also means you need either an internal or external pull-up resistor so that when the peripheral is not selected, it's seeing a positive voltage on its end of the CS wire.\nGiven that there are two roles (controller and peripheral), this indicates that any communication that occurs is at the behest and control of the controller, hence it's name and role.\nPeriphals cannot just random start transmitting. \nThe controller will lower a given a peripheral's CS pin to signal that communications is desired with it.\nAnd then things get weird.\nEven when selected, the peripheral doesn't drive the clock (SCK), so it still can't communicate.\nInstead, the bus works with simultaneous bi-direction communication, driven by the controller.\nFor every byte the controller sends, the peripheral sends a byte.\nOf course, on the face of it, this makes it seem like the controller and peripheral both shout at each other for the same amount of time.\nIn reality, the controller may communicate something (like a request) to the peripheral, and ignore the junk that the peripheral is shouting back at the same time.\nThen, in order to receive a response that includes useful content, the controller will continue to send additional junk to the peripheral (which it ignores) so that it can swap bytes back to the controller.\nThis is sometimes referred to \"clocking out bytes\". The bytes sent by the control in this mode are pretty meaningless, other than defining the clock pulses that the peripheral can use to return data.\nHow does the controller know how much junk to send to give the peripheral a chance to fully reply?\nIn some cases, the on-the-wire protocol may define, thought a reference document, how many bytes to expect. Or the protocol may involve some number of bytes which encode a length of the remainder of the payload.\nIn the case of the eS-WiFi board, there yet another pin, the ready pin, which is controlled by the peripheral.\nAs long as the peripheral keeps that pin high, the controller continues to transmit junk, and gather the response bytes from the peripheral.\nOnce that pin goes low, the controller can stop pumping out junk bytes and know it has the entire response.\nWord up.\nThe HAL for the STM32L4 implements a 8-bit-word-based SPI interface.\nThe eS-WiFi board uses 16-bit words (or roughly... 2 bytes).\nUnfortunately, a 16-bit word is not exactly a straight-line array of two 8-bit bytes.\nReading bytes\nThe eS-Wifi communication involves swapping bytes, if you read in two 8-bit bytes in at a time.\nAnd to read bytes, you have to transmit junk, but in this case, very specific junk: newline bytes.\nHere, we transmit 2 newlines, and the SPI will replace those two characters with two bytes of the peripheral's response (which it actually sent as a single 16-bit word):\nlet mut xfer: [u8; 2] = [0x0A, 0x0A];\nlet result = self.spi.transfer(&amp;mut xfer);\n\nGiven the 8-vs-16 bit wordsize and byte-swapping, we have to read the array backwards.\nThe data should be interpreted in this order:\nlet buffer: [u8;2 ] = [ xfer[1], xfer[0] ]\n\nIf, by chance, we were working with larger arrays of transfers, we'd have to read each pairwise set of bytes in swapped order.\nIn an 8-array, we'd have to interpret the data using indices: 1 0 3 2 5 4 7 and then 6.\nThe eS-WiFi will also send an 0x15 (nak) if it doesn't want to transmit an even number of bytes, as padding.\nWriting bytes\nJust as with reading, the controller has to deal with byte-swapping and padding, but in this case, we must pad with 0x0A (newline) if we don't have an even number of bytes.\nfor chunk in command.chunks(2) {\n    let mut xfer: [u8; 2] = [0; 2];\n    xfer[1] = chunk[0];\n    if chunk.len() == 2 {\n        xfer[0] = chunk[1]\n    } else {\n        xfer[0] = 0x0A\n    }\n\n    let result = self.spi.transfer(&amp;mut xfer);\n\n    ...\n}\n\nEffectively, if we wanted to transmit ['b', 'o', 'b'], we would have to transmit two 2-byte arrays shaped like:\n[ 'o', 'b' ]\n[ '\\n', 'b' ]\n\nOr as a 4-array: [ 'o', 'b', '\\n', 'b']\nFun, yeah?\nBut now you can TCP\nOf course, all of this gets hidden, as it's implementation details for the driver.\nSee the drogue-es-wifi crate's README for details on how to use it to actually do some TCP connections.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/eswifi/","title":"eS-WiFi and SPI"},"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-1/":{"body":"This is the first post in a series (part 2, part 3) about doing device firmware updates (DFU) over the air (OTA) and continuous delivery of firmware for embedded devices. We'll explore the different parts of a complete end-to-end system with this capability.\nThis post will be about a fundamental component in such a system: the bootloader.\nBackground\nFor a connected devices to be maintainable at scale, they must be able to update themselves just like any other software. However, managing a fleet of occasionally connected devices with little bandwidth requires a different approach to delivering software updates to regular applications. One goal for Drogue IoT is to support the entire software update workflow on tiny devices, all the way from building your firmware to delivering it to the device, just like any other modern application.\nBootloader\nA fundamental component in an updatable system is the ability to boot different versions of an application. Making a generic bootloader is hard, because there is a large number of different possible device configurations. The complexity and size of a bootloader is also determined by its functionality: a bootloader being able to retrieve firmware from a network has a bigger footprint than one that only loads an application from a fixed location in flash.\nSince we're focused on IoT, we can assume that our devices have some form of network connectivity, but we do not wish to tie ourselves to any specific connectivity type. \nMoreover, for many applications, it's desirable to retrieve the updates while the application is running, which excludes some bootloader designs that do the firmware update within the bootloader. Given some connectivity strategies may be slow, this may result in an exceedingly long time not executing the application itself.\nWhat happens on power failure while updating? With devices installed in hard-to-reach locations, it is important that we can gracefully handle such a scenario and fall back to an existing version and try again. Likewise, should the new application not work properly, we want to allow falling back to the previous version known to work.\nFinally, we want to be able to store firmware in external flash, which has potentially different page and transfer sizes than the internal on-chip flash.\nIntroducing embassy-boot\nAfter thinking about the above requirements and exploring existing bootloaders, we decided to write a bootloader made for embassy, with inspiration from other attempts in the Rust community. The goal was to write a bootloader that met both the above requirements and that would benefit the entire Rust embedded community.\nThe result of that work now lives in embassy-boot. The embassy-boot bootloader is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks. \nThe bootloader consists of two parts, a platform independent part and a platform dependent part. The platform independent part is a standard Rust library (and there are unit tests using an in-memory 'flash' for testing correctness) that can be used to build your custom bootloader. The platform-dependent part ties the generic library to a specific hardware platform, such as nRF or STM32. This provides some hardware-specific functionality, for instance integration with nrf-softdevice or a watchdog timer for nRF devices.\nNOTE: Do I need to use embassy with embassy-boot? Absolutely not! embassy-boot just happens to use embassy internally for the platform dependent parts. The application side uses async APIs to write firmware (preventing you blocking other tasks while writing firmware to flash), but does not require any specific runtime or HAL, as long as it implements the embedded-storage interface.\nThe bootloader flash memory is divided into logical areas named Partitions:\n\n    \n    Bootloader partitions\n\nEach partition is an area of flash on a microcontroller, but only the Bootloader and Active partitions need to be on the same physical flash storage. This means you can use off-chip flash to store the firmware update if desired.\nThe Bootloader partition contains the bootloader application itself, usually around 8kB if disabling debug logging. The Bootloader State partition contains a flag indicating if firmware within the Active and DFU partitions should be swapped or not, as well as a progress index used by the swap and revert algorithm.\nThe Active partition contains the currently running firmware, and the bootloader will always jump to the application at the start of the Active  partition. The DFU partition contains the \"next\" firmware to be updated, until the update is signaled, at which point the bootloader will gradually swap it with the \"old\" firmware.\nInitial boot\nAt initial boot, the bootloader performs the following operations:\n\nRead current bootloader state magic word.\nIf no \"SWAP\" magic bytes found, boot the current firmware.\nIf \"SWAP\" magic bytes found, perform the swap between the Active and DFU firmwares.\nBoot the new current firmware.\n\nUpdating the firmware\nAn application that wants to be capable of firmware update will need to create an instance of a FirmwareUpdater. This is provided by the embassy-boot library, with defaults available if using the embassy-boot-nrf or embassy-boot-stm32 libraries. The FirmwareUpdater is capable of the following operations:\n\nWrite firmware to any offset within the DFU partition.\nMark the current running firmware as 'OK', to prevent a firmware rollback.\nMark the current firwmare to be swapped by the new firmware.\n\nTo create an updater instance with configuration from linker script:\nlet mut updater = FirmwareUpdater::default();\n\nHow the firmware gets to the device is not the responsibility of the FirmwareUpdater, which leaves this problem to the application itself. In the next blog post, we will cover different ways you can get the firmware to the device.\nTo write a firmware block to flash (data must meet the alignment requirements of the flash instance you're providing):\nupdater.write_firmware(offset, &amp;[0, 1, 2, 3], &amp;mut flash).await\n\nThis allows you to write firmware in smaller pieces at a time, which might be necessary for constrainted devices.\nOnce the new firmware is written, it is marked to be swapped with the current firmware by invoking the update method:\nupdater.update(&amp;mut flash).await\n\nOnce returned, the application needs to reset the device. Upon reset, the device will enter the bootloader once again, and attempt to swap the firmware before booting the next version.\nNOTE: By structuring your application accordingly, you may update the firmware in parallel while running other tasks. This reduces the downtime of your application to a minimum.\nSwap algorithm\nAt the core of the bootloader is the partition swapping algorithm, which is not tied to any specific platform. The algorithm is based on earlier work by Dario Nieuwenhuis (who created the embassy project) and extended so support more configuration. The algorithm keeps an internal state of the copy progress in flash, using 1 word per index value which ensures that only a single erase is needed before starting the swap process, as opposed to erase + write for every index counter update.\nLets assume a flash size of 3 pages for the Active partition, and 4 pages for the DFU partition. The swap index contains the copy progress, as to allow detecting if copy is completed or not on power failure. The index counter is represented within 1 or more pages (depending on total flash size), where a page X is considered swapped if index at location (X + WRITE_SIZE) contains a non-erased value. This ensures that index updates can be performed atomically and avoid a situation where the wrong index value is set (page write size is \"atomic\").\nThe initial state of the Active, DFU and State partitions are shown below:\n\n    \n    Initial State\n\nThe State partition is only showing the index for the Active partition for simplicity. The algorithm starts by copying 'backwards', and after the first step, the layout is as follows:\n\n    \n    Copy State 1\n\nThe next iteration performs the same steps:\n\n    \n    Copy State 2\n\nAnd again until we're done:\n\n    \n    Final State\n\nThe reverting algorithm uses the swap index to check if images were swapped, or that the application failed to mark the boot successful. In this case, the revert algorithm will\nrun.\nThe revert index is located separately from the swap index, to ensure that revert can continue on power failure.\nAnother thing to note is that the revert algorithm works forwards, by copying into the 'unused' DFU page at the start.\nOnce the swap process is complete, the bootloader may jump to the application at the beginning of the active partition.\nThis is a platform-specific step done in the embassy-boot-stm32 or embassy-boot-nrf part of the bootloader.\nNOTE: The new application is responsible for marking itself as successfully booted, otherwise the bootloader will attempt to revert to the previous application when restarted!\nThe application marks itself as successfully booted by invoking mark_booted:\nupdater.mark_booted(&amp;mut flash).await\n\nPower fail safety\nWhat happens if the swap process is interrupted during the copy? Can we still revert back to the old version in a half-copied state? Yes! After a power failure, the device may be in one of the following states during the update process:\n\nFirmware has been written, but not instructed to update. In this case, no action is taken and the old firmware will be used.\nShould swap, but swap is not complete. In this case, the bootloader will continue the swap operation from where it left off. The crucial step in this process is that the page copy progress state is written atomically.\nSwap is complete, but is still instructed to update. In this case, the bootloader will assume that something went wrong with the new application and will start to revert to the previous application.\nShould revert, but revert is not complete. Similar to the previous state, the revert process will continue where it left off until complete.\n\nRolling back\nSo your application got updated, but you had a bug in your application causing it to crash! Now what? Well, there are a few key principles that should be met within your application to ensure that you don't get 'stuck'. On a reset, the bootloader will take care of swapping back the existing firmware, so make sure that:\n\nIn the event of an unrecoverable error, panic! Make sure you use a panic handler that allows your device to reset and start over (causing the bootloader to roll back).\nYour application is running correctly before marking itself as successfully booted. Doing this too early could cause your application to be stuck with the new faulty firmware.\n\nFor IoT connected devices, there is an additional trick: make sure you can connect to the required services (such as the firmware update service) before marking the firmware as successfully booted. This increases the chance you will be able to recover and fix bugs by rolling out a new version of your firmware. We'll cover this in future blog posts of this series.\nBootloader and application binaries\nThe bootloader may be used as a library or as a standalone binary. In the case where it's used as a standalone binary, it must be compiled with the linker script setting the partition boundaries. If you require a high degree of customization, you can use it as a library and provide the partitions programatically.\nThe application binary can depend on the platform dependent bootloader library for convenience, which will also use the linker script to derive the partition boundaries. In the same way as for making a customized bootloader, you can define the partition boundaries programatically for your application as well.\nA typical dependency graph of an application myapp using embassy-boot is shown below:\n\n    \n    Bootloader Dependencies\n\nApplication linker script\nThe linker script defines the partition boundaries. It is only needed if you don't want to define the partition limits in code. A linker script may look like this for an nRF52 application:\nMEMORY\n{\n  /* NOTE 1 K = 1 KiBi = 1024 bytes */\n  BOOTLOADER                        : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 24K\n  BOOTLOADER_STATE                  : ORIGIN = 0x00006000, LENGTH = 4K\n  FLASH                             : ORIGIN = 0x00007000, LENGTH = 64K\n  DFU                               : ORIGIN = 0x00017000, LENGTH = 68K\n  RAM                         (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000008, LENGTH = 32K\n}\n\n__bootloader_state_start = ORIGIN(BOOTLOADER_STATE);\n__bootloader_state_end = ORIGIN(BOOTLOADER_STATE) + LENGTH(BOOTLOADER_STATE);\n\n__bootloader_dfu_start = ORIGIN(DFU);\n__bootloader_dfu_end = ORIGIN(DFU) + LENGTH(DFU);\n\nThe BOOTLOADER section is not strictly necessary but shown for documentation purposes. The locations starting with __bootloader* are read by the FirmwareUpdater default initialization code to learn the partition limits. Note that the Active partition is not known by the FirmwareUpdater but is effectively the FLASH region as defined in the above linker script.\nBootloader binary\nThe bootloader binary itself is only concerned with initializing peripherals and the bootloader before loading the application. \nThe standard out of the box bootloader application looks like this:\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    // Initialize the peripherals\n    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());\n    \n    // Setup flash used to store firmware\n    let mut flash = Nvmc::new(p.NVMC);\n\n    // Create bootloader using partition limits derived from linker script\n    let mut bl: BootLoader = BootLoader::default();\n    \n    // Prepare the bootloader for launching the application, performs necessary swap or rollback operation depending on the internal state.\n    // You can provide your own FlashProvider implementation if you want to use separate flash for Active, DFU and State partitions.\n    let start = bl.prepare(&amp;mut SingleFlashProvider::new(&amp;mut flash));\n\n    // Ensures flash is dropped again before launching application\n    core::mem::drop(flash);\n    \n    // Load application (fingers crossed)\n    unsafe { bl.load(start) }\n}\n\nBootloader linker script\nThe linker script defines the partition boundaries. It is only needed if you don't want to write your own bootloader binary. A linker script may look like this for an nRF52 application:\nMEMORY\n{\n  /* NOTE 1 K = 1 KiBi = 1024 bytes */\n  FLASH                             : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 24K\n  BOOTLOADER_STATE                  : ORIGIN = 0x00006000, LENGTH = 4K\n  ACTIVE                            : ORIGIN = 0x00007000, LENGTH = 64K\n  DFU                               : ORIGIN = 0x00017000, LENGTH = 68K\n  RAM                         (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000008, LENGTH = 32K\n}\n\n__bootloader_state_start = ORIGIN(BOOTLOADER_STATE);\n__bootloader_state_end = ORIGIN(BOOTLOADER_STATE) + LENGTH(BOOTLOADER_STATE);\n\n__bootloader_active_start = ORIGIN(ACTIVE);\n__bootloader_active_end = ORIGIN(ACTIVE) + LENGTH(ACTIVE);\n\n__bootloader_dfu_start = ORIGIN(DFU);\n__bootloader_dfu_end = ORIGIN(DFU) + LENGTH(DFU);\n\nThe difference to the application linker script is minimal. The FLASH region is now in the bootloader region. The Active partition boundaries are also required to be known by the bootloader.\nPortability\nAs we've seen above, only a small amount of code is required to write your own bootloader using embassy-boot. Extending to new hardware platforms within the STM32 family requires adding a working flash driver for that chip, at which point the embassy-boot-stm32 library should work with that particular family. For different chip vendors and architectures like RISC-V, creating another embassy-boot-riscv would be needed, but still the amount of hardware-specific code should only be related to setting up peripherals and providing the correct boot process for that hardware.\nExamples\nTo get started using embassy-boot, you can find ready-made examples in embassy for several chips. If you have a board that is not listed, reach out in the embassy chat or contribute an example yourself.\nWe also have a demonstrating the use of embassy-boot and the swap + rollback logic:\n\nAlternatives\nThere are many existing bootloaders, like mcuboot, which probably has the best device and feature support. However, building and running a C based bootloader and adapting it to work with embassy is also not as nice as using Rust tooling and being able to reuse the hardware support already in embassy. \nAnother bootloader with a similar approach to embassy-boot is moonboot, which shares a similar design with a split responsibility between the bootloader and application but is even more generic (not tied to embassy, but also means more work to use) and (at the time of writing) not power fail safe. Clearly there is an opportunity for collaboration in the future.\nUPDATE: An alternative to using a swap algorithm could be to have two active partitions, and have the bootloader switch between loading each of them. However, this would require using different linker scripts depending on which partition you wanted to use, because Rust does not yet support position independent code.\nFuture work\n\nAdding support for more hardware platforms. At present, the nRF52 and STM32 platforms are supported, but not all STM32 families have a working flash driver. Supporting hardware like the Raspberry Pi Pico is also on the wish list.\nFirmware verification. Being able to install a trusted public key in the bootloader that can be used to verify a firmware signature before swapping/booting.\nAdditional bootloader capabilities such as having a fail safe partition with 'factory settings' in case reverting fail.\n\nSummary\nIn this first post in a series, we have looked at the fundamental microcontroller component required to support firmware updates. We first had a look at the features required from a bootloader, and then had a look at the newly created embassy-bootand learned how it swaps firmware. Finally we've discussed what it means to be power safe and how embassy-boot ensures that application updates are reliable, with some delegation of that responsibility of the application to mark itself as 'OK'.\nIn the next blog post, we will have a look at different mechanisms for getting the firmware onto the device itself.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-1/","title":"Firmware updates, part 1: Bootloader"},"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-2/":{"body":"This is the second post in a series (part 1, part 3) about doing device firmware updates (DFU) over the air (OTA) and continuous deployment of firmware for embedded devices. We'll explore the different parts of a complete end-to-end system with this capability.\nThis post will be about the different networks and how you can manage firmware updates using them.\nBackground\nIn the previous post, we explored the bootloader component required to do firmware updates in a power fail-safe way. Now that we've got a working bootloader, let's take a look at how we can get the firmware on the device itself.\n\n    \n    Target system\n\nIt is assumed that there is some kind of update service that the device communicates with. This could be a direct connection in the network, or via a gateway. In this article we'll have a look at some widely used alternatives:\n\nWiFi/Ethernet/LTE-M\nLoRaWAN\nBLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)\nSerial/UART\n\nSome of these can easily be adapted to a IPv4/IPv6-based network, and may therefore run directly on the embedded devices. Others like BLE require a custom component to translate between the GATT services and the IP network. For BLE and serial, one can use the drgdfu library and tool for this purpose. For LoRaWAN, integration with the network provider such as TTN handles the forwarding of data to/from the update service.\nIP-based\nIf your devices has WiFi and/or Ethernet capabilities, then talking to the server becomes a lot easier. The downsides are power usage and range (WiFi) or the need for using wires (Ethernet). Even so, you might need a TCP/IP implementation. Many WiFi adapters already provide a TCP/IP implementation which you interact with using AT commands. Drogue Device contains drivers for the ESP8266 and eS-WiFi that you can use with embassy. \nIn the cases where you don't have a TCP/IP implementation, you can use an open source implementation. In the C world, there is LwIP, but in the world we care most about (Rust), there is smoltcp. \nLoRaWAN\nLoRaWAN is a wide area wireless protocol for devices that infrequently sends sensor data. Devices consume little power and transmit data over long distances compared to WiFi or BLE. However, LoRaWAN networks also have bandwidth limitations. For instance, doing a 64kB firmware update using the TTN free tier network would take 4 days! Things look a bit better if running your own network, but you'll still be limited by regulated bandwith usage and the lower limit is 4 hours for 64kB.\nThe being said, spending 4 hours or 4 days to update firmware of IoT sensors might not be problem for many applications, and as long as the update service supports such a low pace, it works as expected.\nLTE-M / NB-IoT\nLTE-M/NB-IoT device consume more power than LoRaWAN devices. On the other hand, the network coverage and bandwidth is a lot higher. With LTE-M you can get up to 1 mbit downlink speeds (under ideal conditions!), which allows you to quickly download firmware when there is an update. These devices often contains a TCP/IP implementation allowing you to connect directly to firmware update services. If you can live with the higher power usage and the additional cost (as it usually involves a montly subscription to the provider), this option can be a good way to ensure you have firmware update capability for your device.\nWe don't have any examples for LTE-M / NB-IoT at present, but in general the approach would be similar to IP based networks. Have a look at this repository for an example sending data over LTE-M/NB-IoT.\nBLE / Thread / ZigBee\nThese standards are designed to work well with low power devices, but with limited range and not directly interoperable with an IP network (6LoWPAN allows that, but it is IPv6 only and not widely supported). Because of that, they need a gateway component to reach the internet. \nFor BLE, there is no standard firmware update GATT service UUID defined, so a custom service must be defined.\nSerial\nThe good old serial interface is a simple but flexible way to upload firmware. The downside of serial is of course that it is wired, but it can be a nice 'fallback' for cases where you need to go on site anyway as it's reasonably fast and efficient.\nIntroducing embedded-update\nFor devices that can connect directly to the network and maps well to a \"pull\" model for retrieving firmware updates, we've created the embedded-update crate. embedded-update defines a firmware update protocol than can be plugged in to different firmware update services and update capable devices. It performs the firmware update process using implementations for the UpdateService and FirmwareDevice traits from the application. \n\n    \n    Overview of embedded-update\n\nAt the time of writing, drogue-device contains an implementation of UpdateService for Drogue Cloud, and an implementation of FirmwareDevice based on embassy-boot. For the full example, have a look at this STM32L4 (WiFi) example.\nLet's look at an example using embedded-update with Drogue Cloud and the embassy-boot bootloader.\nThe firmware revision is embedded into the firmware by reading it from the environment at build time:\nconst FIRMWARE_VERSION: &amp;str = env!(\"CARGO_PKG_VERSION\");\nconst FIRMWARE_REVISION: Option&lt;&amp;str&gt; = option_env!(\"REVISION\");\n\nBy default, it will use the version specified in the Cargo.toml, but this can be overridden by setting the REVISION environment variable during build. As mentioned in the previous article, an instance of the updater that writes to flash is created:\nlet updater = embassy_boot_stm32::FirmwareUpdater::default();\n\nThe updater will read partition settings from the predefined locations supplied by the linker scripts. The next step is to \ncreate an instance of the FirmwareDevice. As mentioned earlier, an instance of this trait exists that wraps the types from embedded-storage and embassy-boot.\nlet version = FIRMWARE_REVISION.unwrap_or(FIRMWARE_VERSION);\nlet mut device: FirmwareManager&lt;Flash, 2048, 256&gt; = FirmwareManager::new(flash, updater, version.as_bytes());\n\nThe FirmwareManager ensures that writes to the flash are done in page size chunks, configurable using the const generics.\nNext we need to create an instance of the UpdateService we want to use. There are several options here, but in this case we are using Drogue Cloud directly, in which case we can use the DrogueHttp update service, which uses HTTPS with the Drogue Cloud endpoints:\nlet service: DrogueHttpUpdateService&lt;'_, _, _, 256&gt; = DrogueHttpUpdateService::new(\n    network,\n    rng,\n    SocketAddr::new(IpAddr::new(65, 108, 135, 161), 443),\n    \"http.sandbox.drogue.cloud\",\n    \"device1@example-app\",\n    \"hey-rodney\"\n);\n\nThe network instance is any type implementing the TcpClient trait from embedded-nal-async, so you can use this client with different TCP implementations. The rng is used by embedded-tls when establishing the TLS connection to Drogue Cloud.\nNow that we have both an implementation for the UpdateService and FirmwareDevice, we can create and invoke the FirmwareUpdater which performs the update protocol together with these two:\nlet mut updater = embedded_update::FirmwareUpdater::new(\n    service,\n    embedded_update::UpdaterConfig {\n        timeout_ms: 40_000,\n        backoff_ms: 100,\n    },\n);\n\nThe UpdaterConfig contains two configuration options to tune the timeout and retry behavior:\n\ntimeout_ms - the timeout to give the request passed to the update service before retrying.\nbackoff_ms - the number of milliseconds to wait before retrying a failed or timed out request.\n\nFinally, we create a task that runs the updater that runs in parallel with the rest of the application:\n#[embassy::task]\nasync fn updater_task(...) {\n    ...\n    loop {\n        match updater.run(&amp;mut device, &amp;mut Delay).await {\n            Ok(s) =&gt; {\n                match s {\n                    DeviceStatus::Updated =&gt; {\n                        defmt::debug!(\"Resetting device\");\n                        cortex_m::peripheral::SCB::sys_reset();\n                    }\n                    DeviceStatus::Synced(delay) =&gt; {\n                        if let Some(delay) = delay {\n                            Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(delay as u64)).await;\n                        } else {\n                            Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            Err(e) =&gt; {\n                defmt::warn!(\"Error running updater: {:?}\", e);\n                Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nA single run of the updater returns an DeviceStatus which is an enum with two variants:\n\nDeviceStatus::Synced(Option&lt;u32&gt;) - returned when the firmware is up to date and marked as 'successfully booted'. In this case, the application is free to re-run the updater at a later time, as an optional u32 with the amount of seconds it should wait.\nDeviceStatus::Updated - returned when the firmware updater process is complete. In this case, the application is responsible for resetting the device so that the new firmware can be swapped.\n\nWith that, we have a continuously running update process in our application, that can run together with other tasks in the application.\nSimilar to the IP based example, we can use the same embedded-update crate to enable firmware updates for our lorawan device. An implementation of the UpdateService for LoRaWAN is provided in drogue-device.\nIn addition, the embedded-update crate provides a Serial implementation of the UpdateService trait that works with traits from embedded-io and using postcard with a fixed-frame format. This way, the protocol can be used not only for serial, but also USB, TCP and UDP if desired. Likewise, a Serial implementation of the FirmwareDevice trait is also provided, allowing you to use embedded-update on both sides of the link.\nUpdating BLE devices\nWith BLE, a \"push\" model for firmware is more appropriate because the BLE peripheral acts as the server. For this case, we have implemented a FirmwareService using the nrf-softdevice crate supported by the nRF52 chip families:\n\n    \n    Updates over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)\n\nThe actual GATT service definition looks like this:\n// The FirmwareUpdate GATT service\n#[nrf_softdevice::gatt_service(uuid = \"00001000-b0cd-11ec-871f-d45ddf138840\")]\npub struct FirmwareService {\n    /// Version of current running firmware\n    #[characteristic(uuid = \"00001001-b0cd-11ec-871f-d45ddf138840\", read)]\n    version: Vec&lt;u8, 16&gt;,\n\n    /// Max firmware block size for device\n    #[characteristic(uuid = \"00001002-b0cd-11ec-871f-d45ddf138840\", read)]\n    mtu: u8,\n\n    /// State control\n    #[characteristic(uuid = \"00001003-b0cd-11ec-871f-d45ddf138840\", write)]\n    control: u8,\n\n    /// Version being written\n    #[characteristic(uuid = \"00001004-b0cd-11ec-871f-d45ddf138840\", write, read)]\n    next_version: Vec&lt;u8, 16&gt;,\n\n    /// Current write offset\n    #[characteristic(uuid = \"00001005-b0cd-11ec-871f-d45ddf138840\", read)]\n    offset: u32,\n\n    /// Firmware data to be written\n    #[characteristic(uuid = \"00001006-b0cd-11ec-871f-d45ddf138840\", write)]\n    firmware: Vec&lt;u8, 64&gt;,\n}\n\nThe service expose settings that are relevant to the firmware update process:\n\nversion - the current version running on the device.\nmtu - the preferred block size to transfer over the BLE link.\ncontrol - a control signal for setting the expected state on the device.\nnext_version and offset - contains the current version being written and the next expected offset.\nfirmware - the characteristic where the payload for the next offset is written.\n\nThe drgdfu tool implements a GATT client for interacting with this service, whereas drogue-device provides an implementation that adapts the above service to a FirmwareDevice trait from embedded-update as shown in the overview diagram. You can thus update the firmware of your device from a file by running:\ndrgdfu upload ble-gatt --device ED:38:1E:3E:99:B6 --enable-discovery file --firmware update.bin --metadata update.json\n\nYou can also update the device from Drogue Cloud by running:\ndrgdfu upload ble-gatt --device ED:38:1E:3E:99:B6 --enable-discovery cloud --http https://http.sandbox.drogue.cloud --application example-app --device ble-gateway --password hey-rodney\n\nThis requires setting up Drogue Ajour on the server side to manage the firmware, which we'll cover in the next article in this series.\nSummary\nWe've compared the different options for connecting devices to a firmware update server, and the considerations that need to be taken for each. The embedded-update crate implements a firmware update protocol that can work with update services that follow as similar \"pull model\". However, for some devices like BLE, an additional component is needed in between that defines a custom protocol for doing the update.\nNext steps\nAs mentioned earlier, some of the implementations for the embedded-update traits are still located in drogue-device. Once embedded-nal-async stabilizes, we'd like to move these implementations to embedded-update. There are also other update services that would be interesting to integrate with, and implementing one for Eclipse Hawkbit is high on the todo list.\nIf you are building your own service or are using existing services that you would like to see supported in embedded-update, reach out to us in the chat or on GitHub! Likewise, if you have devices that do not work with the current embedded-storage and embassy-boot based device, we are more than happy to extend the capabilites in embedded-update.\nIn the next and final article in the series, we'll look at how you can manage firmware and automatically deploy them to devices using Drogue Cloud.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-2/","title":"Firmware updates, part 2: Transporting the update"},"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-3/":{"body":"This is the third post in a series (part 1, part 2) about doing device firmware updates (DFU) over the air (OTA) and continuous deployment of firmware for embedded devices. We'll explore the different parts of a complete end-to-end system with this capability.\nThis post is about how the firmware is delivered to devices and how you can build the firmware using Drogue IoT.\nBackground\nIn the previous post, we explored the ways which you can transport the firmware onto devices across different transports.\nNow we're going to look at the final steps: building and delivering the firmware, based on the update protocol defined by embedded-update. First, let's keep in mind what types of devices we're updating:\n\nNo operating system\nLimited/reduced network connectivity\nSmall amounts of RAM\n\nFor devices that are not as light weight and can run Linux, there are other options such as Flotta that might be a better fit.\nSupporting firmware updates in Drogue IoT is something we've been thinking about for a while, since it's a common piece of any IoT infrastructure. There are many ways to distribute software, but there are a few important properties when dealing with tiny IoT devices:\n\nConnectivity - embedded devices may not be connected at all times and not able to retrieve the entire firmware in one batch\nProtocol support - embedded devices may use a wide rang of different protocols as discussed in the previous post.\nFootprint - memory on devices and bandwidth may be limited, therefore the protocol must impose minimal overhead\n\nOur first attempt was to offload this functionality to an existing project like Eclipse Hawkbit. The Eclipse Hawkbit update protocol is stateless (server processes requests independently) and allows devices to fetch firmware in chunks as requested by device. One downside is that Eclipse Hawkbit update service only supports HTTP with a JSON protocol, not really suitable for tiny devices. Moreover, it requires maintaining the firmware state of a device separately from the device management in Drogue Cloud.\nWith the telemetry and command API of Drogue Cloud, we have all the building blocks needed to transport the firmware. So instead of using Hawkbit directly, we can define an update protocol using Drogue Cloud connectivity as a transport and use the Drogue Cloud integration APIs for our update service. This unlocks some interesting use cases:\n\nThe service can run in a private network not exposed to the public\nThe service can integrate with different backends, such as Eclipse Hawkbit\nThe service can provide updates over any protocol supported by Drogue Cloud\n\nAnother lesson in our experimentation with Rust on embedded devices, is that writing Rust feels like writing software running on a server. This had some implications on how we thought about software for embedded: what if we could apply the same mechanisms and tooling we use for building \"normal\" software to firmware for embedded devices? After all, projects like Tekton allow you to define a CI/CD pipeline that builds any software using container images on Kubernetes. Moreover, container registries are used to store and retrieve software, so maybe we could store firmware in those registries as well?\nThe end result after exploring the above ideas is an add-on to Drogue Cloud named Drogue Ajour (à jour =&gt; updated).\nTo learn more about Drogue Ajour than what is covered by this article, have a look at the documentation. As with all things in Drogue IoT, the code is open source, and available on github.\nDrogue Ajour\nDrogue Ajour is a firmware update and build service for tiny devices connected to Drogue IoT Cloud. It supports a wide range of IoT protocols and uses a low footprint update protocol.\n\n    \n    Drogue Ajour Console - Overview\n\nIt offers:\n\nUpdate service - delivering firmware updates to devices connected to Drogue Cloud\nProtocol support - any protocol supported by Drogue Cloud (HTTP, MQTT, CoAP, LoRaWAN)\nFirmware build - building firmware and storing it in a firmware repository.\n\nRESTful API for inspecting and triggering builds\n\n\nManagement console to inspect firmware build and roll-out status for all your Drogue Cloud devices\n\nIt is built on top of:\n\nDrogue Cloud - For authentication and the connectivity layer for devices\nTekton - For defining a CI/CD pipeline for firmware builds\n\nYou can run Drogue Ajour locally or on a Kubernetes cluster. With it, you can build a firmware delivery pipeline for your devices in Drogue Cloud.\nOverview\nDrogue Ajour is composed of 2 main components serving different functions:\n\nFirmware Delivery - Transporting firmware updates to devices\nFirmware Build - Building and storing firmware artifacts\n\nOf these, only the firmware delivery component is mandatory.\n\n    \n    Drogue Ajour Architecture\n\nFirmware delivery\nFirmware delivery is the main functionality of Drogue Ajour. This involves transporting the firmware to devices using a CBOR-based protocol (Concise Binary Object Representation). Although more compact formats than CBOR exists, it is an IETF standard as well as having implementations in many languages. The CBOR messages are designed for minimal overhead, and to allow devices to consume updates at their own pace.\nThe update service can use the file system, Eclipse Hawkbit or a Docker/Container registry for retrieving firmware.\nTo enable firmware updates, the Drogue Cloud Application and Device schema is extended with a section for specifying the firmware source, which looks like this for a container registry:\nspec:\n    firmware:\n        container:\n            image: my-firmware:latest\n\nThe container image reference is relative to the container registry configured for the Drogue Ajour instance. A device reports its firmware status periodically to Drogue Ajour using the 'dfu' Drogue Cloud channel. The update service will look for messages on this channel, and compare the status with the latest firmware stored in the image. If needed, it will proceed by sending updates back to the device using the Drogue Cloud command API. If the device is still waiting for a command (usually within a timeout), or is connecting at a later time, it will receive the firmware data corresponding to it's status message.\n\n    \n    Drogue Ajour Console - Device View\n\nThe update protocol is stateless, meaning that Drogue Ajour will track only send out firmware updates to each individual status update reported by devices. NOTE: In the event that devices are not awaiting command messages with a sufficiently long timeout, duplicate messages may occur, so the timeout is an important consideration to avoid that depending on how the device is connected.\nFirmware build\nThis is an optional component that allow you to build your firmware from source and make it available to the delivery component for rolling out to your devices (aka Source-To-Firmware).\nDrogue Ajour provides Tekton pipeline definitions that can build firmware images in the expected format and push them to container registries.\n\n    \n    Drogue Ajour Console - Build View\n\nBuild specification\nThe specification put on the Application and Device for delivering firmware is extended to add build capabilities, but this is only available for firmware stored in container images at the moment:\nspec:\n    firmware:\n        container:\n            image: my-firmware:latest\n            build:\n                # An image reference to a container image used to build your project\n                image: docker.io/myorg/firmware-builder-image:latest\n                source:\n                    git:\n                        # Git repository URI\n                        uri: https://github.com/myorg/example-project\n                        # Project folder within repository\n                        project: repo/sub/folder\n                        # Git revision to use\n                        rev: main\n                # Arguments passed to the builder image\n                args:\n                - flag1\n                - flag2\n                artifact:\n                    # Path to artifact generated by builder image\n                    path: myartifact.bin\n\nThe builder image contains the tool chain required to build your project. Clearly, a public service offering Drogue Ajour could be exploited to run bitcoin mining, so to avoid that the Drogue Ajour installation can be configured with a set of applications that are allowed to build firmware.\nNOTE: It doesn't have to be a Rust project! It can be any project capable of producing an binary artifact to be delivered to a device as long as your builder image can build it.\nNext steps\nWe've explored the options for providing an update service for the tiny edge. We've looked at the requirements for such as service, and announced the Drogue Ajour add-on for Drogue Cloud.\nTo learn more about Drogue Ajour, have a look at the documentation\nThe Drogue Cloud Sandbox is already running an instance of Drogue Ajour, and you can access the console here using the same credentials as for the Drogue Cloud Sandbox.\nThere are still improvements to be made, and here are some of them\n\nProvide device examples for Zephyr doing firmware updates\nSupport pushing build artifacts to Eclipse Hawkbit\nRetrieving build logs for builds in order to debug build failures\n...\n\nFinal notes\nIn this article series, we've gone through the entire chain from bootloader to firmware to gateway to the cloud, and shown you all the bits you can use to get firmware updates.

This is where I intend to document \nmy progress through discovering how to build enterprise-grade IoT device\nsystems using Rust and ARM Cortex-M MCUs.\nIntroduction\nI'm coming from a background of enterprise Java development, where things\ncan easily be rebooted, debugged, and 16gb of heap can easily be garbage-collected.\nI also have virtually no experience with hardware and electronics.\nAs you can imagine, this journey will be full of frustrations and missteps.\nLet's begin!\nStatus Quo\nThe first project I'm working on, mostly as a way to learn new things, involves\nreplacing a project I've already built before once: Mr Weathery.  Mr Weathery\nis built using the Particle.io cloud and Arduino-like devices, plus a Raspberry Pi\n3B+ sitting in corner. \nThe Pi runs a node.js application that periodically polls the Netatmo weather \ncloud for data from my local weather sensors. It'd also poll the DarkSky APIs for weather\nforecasts. It would then put all of this information on the Particle.io message bus.\nThe first Particle.io device has both WiFi and BLE on-board, and running stock firmware\nit simple acts as a bridge from the IP-based Particle cloud to my main Particle.io board that\nonly speaks BLE, which consumes all of the abovementioned data.\nThe BLE-only board drives an e-paper display to handily show the current and forecast\nweather conditions.\n\nThat's 3 boards, 2 clouds, and a 1 third-party API involved to simply tell me it's raining,\nor will be raining tomorrow. Given the machinations around some of these vendors, \nI realized I should reformulate how Mr Weathery works.\nPlus, given it's a known problem domain with at least one known solution to me,\nI can concentrate on the implementation, not on the specification and design.\nThe New Plan\nWhen originally designed, Mr Weathery was intended to be battery-powered, hence the\nusage of the BLE board.  In reality, he's always plugged into the power mains, so the\nlow-power requirement is less important. \nIf the display can also have consistent power, he can also perform all of the HTTP-over-WiFi \ndancing directly. That would allow me to remove both the Raspberry Pi and the \nWiFi-to-BLE bridge to produce a standalone device.\nInstead of programming an Arduino-like device using C, I'm moving to an \nSTM32 ARM Cortex-M\nchip to power it, using Rust. This is quite the change for me. So far I quite enjoy Rust,\nand the Cortex-M is a nice 32bit processor with more power than many Arduino-like boards.\nThe downside, thus far, is that the STM32s don't have WiFi on-board. While I could adapter boards\nor shields to a dev-kit, I'd ultimately like to fabricate a custom board around the MCU and\nuse a simpler/smaller pre-certified WiFi module.\nGiven I have a bag of Espressif ESP8266 modules handy, \nI'm approaching it as my WiFi adapter.\n\nFor the time-being, I'm using an STM32F401RE development board \nrunning at 84mhz for building the software. It has the benefit of having a USB port with ST-Link on-board\nfor easily flashing and debugging the code.\nBecause Nothing is Easy\nOf course, nothing ever is easy.\nThe ESP8266 is available through the USART \non the STM32. It's fairly simple to wire\nup, and it communicates with Hayes AT commands to enumerate available WiFi access points,\njoin a network, open sockets and communicate.  The AT commands are pretty well documented,\nbut I discovered my bag of ESP8266 were flashed with firmware in... 2016.  And they don't\nmatch the current capabilities documented by Espressif. \nThe ESP8266 runs an Xtensa chip, which is not currently supported by embedded Rust on the \nmainline, and frankly, writing software directly for the ESP8266 would be an effort in \nYak-shaving, so I simply need to update its stock firmware to a newer version.\nWhile people speak of \"ESP8266\" as a thing, it's actually many things, with varying amount \nof memory on-board. Mine has 1mb. Espressif has had varying degrees of diligence in producing\nfirmware versions that fit the various sizes of ESPs. Thankfully, a repository exists with\na slightly improved build/flash situation to target whatever size ESP you might have:\nESP8266_AT_LoBo GitHub Repository\nThis repository is definitely Linux-centric, but a few edits to the various scripts, and\nit runs will enough on OSX to work.\nTo flash an ESP8266, you need a serial port on your machine, which is provided using\nan FTDI adapter. \nThe FTDI converts a USB port into a few pins of serial port, and also \nprovides 3.3v or 5v of power. There are many warnings on the interwebs that the current \nthey provide is not enough to actually power an ESP during flash or usage.\nTo overcome this potential problem, I'm powering the ESP through a breadboard 3.3v \npower supply.\n\nStay Grounded\nWhile attempting to use the ESP through a serial terminal (because it should operate\nlike your old USRobotics 14.4k Dual Standard modem you used to connect to FidoNet...)\nI was finding a ton of noise, and it didn't work. \nLesson #1: All grounds must be tied together.\nEven if you're not using the power from the FTDI, its ground pin needs to be connected\nto the same ground pin the ESP uses. Serial USART works in relation to a common reference \nvoltage (GND), and if two devices have different concepts of ground, it's just not going to work.\nDon't trust your tools\nUsing the flashing scripts from LoBo, everything appeared successful, yet my device\nkept coming up non-funcitonal. Turns out there are several flash modes for ESPs, and\nthe esptool.py doesn't actually really verify if flashing was successful in terms of\nbeing actually successful. Rather, it just seems to think it successfully sent bytes\ndown the wire.\nLesson #2: Try all variants until you find the one that works.\nIn my case, for my ESP8266, I had to use a flash-mode of dout. \nBack to making progress\nmurray:esp8266-tcp bob$ miniterm.py /dev/tty.usbserial-AB0JSKDU 115200\n--- Miniterm on /dev/tty.usbserial-AB0JSKDU  115200,8,N,1 ---\n--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---\nr␘␂␀l��r�␀�c␂�n�␄␘�␌␘�␌␜��␜p�|���␀�8␂��ǒ��␜p␌␘␌�nn�␂�;�n����␌␛�␌b�#l`␛$`␛␄nn���␀␌␜���l␜�␌␟�␌␜�␌b�␄n��n�䎀l��␌b�ľ~�n�␃����␀l`␛��␒�#�n�␄�r␘␂␎␂nr���;␂��␌?␐��;�␂p�n��܀␌␜�r�␜��␜b��␌␜�␌b�␄n��n�$␏�␜p␌␘��nn�␃��␌␘r␘␂�␒�#�n�␄␏r␘␂␎␂nr���;␂��␌?␐��␂␎r�ےn�␄���߬�\n==============================\nLoBo ESP8266 Bootloader v1.2.0\n==============================\n   Flash map: 2, 1MB (512+512)\n  Flash mode: DOUT, [ESP8285]\nReset reason: POWER_ON\n\nLoading configured firmware (0)\n  Address: 001000\nStarting firmware 0, map 2 from 001000...\n\n\nready\n\n\nI finally got the ESP8266 updated with a modern-ish variant of the firmware and\ncan return to writing Rust for the STM32F401RE in order to actually get that\nboard onto the network.\nMore on that to come.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/first-steps-in-iot/","title":"First Steps in IoT"},"https://blog.drogue.io/hey-rodney/":{"body":"Pushing temperature readings in JSON structures to the cloud is fun, but more fun is to restart your pods by saying:\n\"Hey Rodney, …\". It also is a nice demo, and a good test, to see what fails when your Content-Type is audio/wav\ninstead of application/json.\n\nI tried to create a very basic voice assistant during last years holiday seasons. Letting the kids come up with ideas\nfor some interactions, coming up with some funny responses. The project failed miserably, as most of the services around\nthat turned out to have some serious flaw. Performing wake word detection and speech recognition is challenge, so I\nwas looking out for some existing solutions already. However, my aspiration was still to assemble the different components\nmyself, rather than simply installing a ready-to-run solution like Mycroft.\nRestarting pods\nWhile working on the web console, I had to restart the pods a few times. I can turn on my lights with a voice command,\nwhile typing code at the same time. So why can't I restart the container pods that way? Besides, I was looking for\nsome use case of processing non-JSON payload, running some \"edge\" agent with some \"processing\" workflow, and some\ncloud -side analytics. Turns out, a voice assistant has all of those requirements, and I had a little bit of experience\nfrom last year's failure.\nThe setup\nThe task feels rather simple:\n\nListen for a wake word or phrase (\"Hey Rodney\", though Star Trek fans might prefer \"computer\").\nRecognize words after the wake-word, until some stop condition is reached\nEvaluate the actions to take\nPerform the evaluated actions, possibly giving some acoustic feedback (\"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.\")\n\nSounds easy, eh?\nWake word detection\nI started with Mycroft Precise, an open source wake word listener. It\nis a nightmare to build that. Outdated Python dependencies, a poorly maintained repository, a broken build, and some\nforks trying to fix that. Also, it would have been necessary to train our own model for having our own wake-word.\nHowever, I didn't want to become an expert on machine learning just yet.\nThe predecessor for Mycroft was Pocketsphinx, as research project of the\nCarnegie Mellon University. If has some Python bindings that made my life easier, and it also has a dictionary, which\nallows you to provide keywords in text form, rather than requiring you to train your own model. The downside is, it\nis not as accurate, but I assumed it is good enough for our use case.\nIt also has the capability to detect \"silence\", so it was easy to implement a logic of:\n\nWait for the wake-word\nStart recording\nRecord at least x seconds, stop when detecting silence or more than y seconds have passed\nSend recording to the cloud\n\nSending that to the cloud side was rather easy with the Drogue IoT setup that I already had. So the data ends up\nin a Kafka stream, encoded as a Cloud Event with a content type of audio/wav, ready to be processed.\nSpeech-to-text\nI didn't want to start with speech-to-text transformation on a Raspberry Pi. I tried out\nVosk, which is based on Kaldi, however the speech\nrecognition was far from optimal. I just gave up on that and picked a service I had played with before:\nIBM Watson Speech-to-Text.\nAs events already get processed through Knative eventing, it is easy to replace any of the components in play:\napiVersion: flows.knative.dev/v1\nkind: Sequence\nmetadata:\n  name: hey-rodney\nspec:\n  channelTemplate: …\n  steps:\n    - ref:\n        apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n        kind: Service\n        name: watson-stt-converter\n  reply:\n    ref:\n      kind: Service\n      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n      name: hey-rodney-backend\n\nThe functionality is in the watson-speech-to-text-converter \ncontainer. It simply is converting audio events to JSON events, and I think it would be fun to see this replaced with\nan open source version.\nEvaluating commands\nMy goal was to restart container pods. So yes, I did take a nasty shortcut. A simple Quarkus application\nwhich does some regular expression matching in the incoming transcribed audio, and executes the configured commands:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: hey-rodney-config\ndata:\n  rules.yaml: |\n    rules:\n      - matcher: restart console (pods|parts|pots|ports|plots)\n        commands:\n          - execute: [ \"kubectl\", \"delete\", \"pods\", \"-l\", \"app=console-backend\"]\n          - execute: [ \"kubectl\", \"delete\", \"pods\", \"-l\", \"app=console-frontend\"]\n\nIf you think that is a crude way of doing things, I absolutely agree. PRs welcome 😁\nLessons learned\nProcessing audio is much harder than anticipated. The right microphone, the best wake-word solution, timing, struggles\nwith ALSA and passing in audio devices to containers. The demo leaves much room for improvement. On the other side,\nthe demo is just that: a demo.\nCompressing payload\nCloud Events proposes to keep events compact,\nand proposes a limit of 64 KiB. That may just be a little too much for a few seconds of 16 kHz audio.\nHowever, there is the OPUS codec, an open and royalty-free audio codec, for speech amongst\nother things. A Raspberry Pi 4 can encode the few seconds of audio in around 200ms:\nRecorded 4.9 seconds of audio\nEncoding time: 0.2 s\nPayload size: 9.7KiB\n\nCompared to the original size of the audio, this is a significant improvement:\nRecorded 4.9 seconds of audio\nPayload size: 162.7KiB\n\nModularity through Knative eventing\nUsing Knative eventing, and more specifically Cloud Events made things much simpler. Re-using the HTTP endpoint for\ningesting payload from the device, the speech-to-text container, the custom Quarkus application. All wired up using\nYAML from inside Kubernetes. It also makes testing different components much simpler. Instead of orchestrating a\nbig system test, with all kinds of messaging components, only a few, simple HTTP based tests are required, and you can\ntest each component in isolation.\n\nScaling down to zero can get in your way\nScaling down to zero is great, but not when it comes to creating a voice assistant. Spinning up pods with Rust and\nQuarkus native is rather quick. Still, it takes a few milliseconds here and there and feels like a big lag. Yes, there\nis a simple solution to that, don't scale down to zero 😉. If latency is important to you, you can still have all the\nbenefits.\nWhat's next\nCurrently, there is no way to response back to a device. \"Command &amp; control\" is a feature that we are currently working\non. A first version has already landed in the main branch, but it is too early to work with that already. This means\nthat it is also not possible yet to send some audio back to the speaker. However, once we have C&amp;C, sending JSON back\nthe chain, converting from text to speech, shouldn't be a big deal with the setup we have. The beauty of Cloud Events.\nPlease don't forget: this is just an example. We don't want to replicate a solution like Mycroft. So, there are no real\nplans on \"what to do next\".\nThen again: It would be great to bring this solution on some embedded device. Tensorflow Lite runs on microcontrollers\nas well. So we could port the wake-word and audio-snippet-recording part to some embedded device, and keep the\nrest of the pipeline as is. Maybe you are interested in a Google Summer of Code project: Implement \"Hey Rodney\" Drogue IoT demo using Tensorflow (Lite) 😉. \nMission accomplished?\nKind of. It was fun, I learned a lot! It sits there, runs on a Raspberry Pi, and after a few attempts, it restarts\nthe console pods. Accuracy could be much better. Then again, that lets you have more respect for the smart speaker\nyou might have at home.\nIf you want to replicate this, bring some time and patience, and take a look at the links below.\nSee also\n\nhey-rodney repository\nhey-rodney-backend repository\ndrogue-cloud repository\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/hey-rodney/","title":"\"Hey Rodney, … restart console pods\""},"https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-device/":{"body":"Trying to bring reusable and efficient components to embedded Rust has been a challenge for our team.\nWe think we've started to make headway, and want to introduce the Drogue Device project.\nBackground\nA lot of embedded frameworks and RTOSs rely on procedural coding, \"copy these source files into your tree\" or a lot of manual connection of APIs to the runtime.\nSince We Are Red Hat (or IBM, or more specifically/historically \"JBoss\"), we like reusable components. And frameworks.\nThey represent guardrails and provide guidance on how to build larger systems, we feel.\nComponent Systems\nIn enterprise software, component systems abound. \nThere's Enterprise Java Beans, Actix, CDI, Vert.x, Node.js, Akka framework, Quarkus, Spring, etc.\nMany of these component systems tend to rely on multi-threading capability of the underlying system, and bring about concurrency issues, such as shared-state and locking.\nActor Systems\nOf these systems, Akka is an actor system, which attempts to draw clear lines about ownership and control of state and data, helping alleviate concurrency concerns.\nAn actor within an actor system believes that it is single-threaded, serially processing requests that arrive which desire to operate upon the data it controls.\nThis seemingly single-threaded nature allows an actor to avoid locking of its data. \nAll mutations occur from the POV of the actor himself, triggered by message passing from external sources which make requests.\nMessaging\nCommon messaging patterns include fire-and-forget notifications from one component to another, and request/response between two components.\nSometimes components want to ambiguously broadcast messages to whichever unknown components might be interested. \nThis third type is basically an event bus.\nTask Scheduling\nAn actor that thinks it is single-threaded is great, but our MCUs usually also only have one core, and thus one thread.\nA slow actor, or one that blocks the thread of execution can bring the entire system to a halt.\nJust because one actor hits a wall and can make no further progress, another actor might be able to do some meaningful work, unblocking the first.\nPreemptive Task Scheduling\nIf you have a preemptive thread or task scheduler, then a kernel is slicing up processor time. \nAn task is given a certain number of cycles (or milliseconds, or reductions or whatever unit measurement used to slice the time pie), and when the \ntimer expires, the kernel forcibly pause the task and select another one to run for a slice of time.\nNaive implementations will allow a blocked task to continue to block until his time-slice expires.\nOther implementations allow a task to indicate that it is blocked, and relinquish any remaining time, cooperatively.\nRun-to-Completion Task Scheduling\nSome schedulers select a task, and allow it to run to completion, even if it's slow, or blocks briefly. \nThe onus is on the developer to ensure his tasks will not completely halt or take too much time. \nRun-to-completion semantics can be great when you have a task you absolutely need to have, well, run to completion before being put into the queue to run again later.\nCooperative Task Scheduling\nA cooperative task scheduler allows a task to run until it can't or doesn't want to run any more.\nIn this way, the tasks must cooperate. \nA task may have an infinite loop that never completes, and if he doesn't pass or yield control back, will consume 100% of the processor, 100% of the time.\nThis is a sub-optimal situation.\nCooperative task scheduling can be improved by language support for asynchronous architectures, where the language can implicitly be aware when a task can no longer make progress.\nThis results in the task being immediately pulled off the active queue, and another ready and waiting task to be selected to do some work.\nThis doesn't solve the tight-loop problem, where a task must still cooperatively pass control back to the kernel.\nDrogue Device Architecture\nGiven the above background, along with implementing an untold number of proofs-of-concept, we've selected the following key points for our system:\n\nActor-based: State is held by an actor, accessed/mutated only by that actor, in response to messages.\nCooperative Scheduling: Using Rust's async/await support, actors attempt to be non-blocking and share the processor.\nMessage-Passing: Support notifications, requests/responses, and an event-bus.\n\nThe Actors\nFirst, being an actor system, the primary point-of-interest is the actor. \nDrogue Device supports two flavors of actor: Plain Ol' Actors and Interrupt Actors.\nPlain Ol' Actors\nThe general case of an actor is a component that contains state, and can manipulate it in response to messages.\nTheir only interface with the outside world is messages. \nTo ensure that no other code can directly twiddle an actor, the primary handle on an actor is an Address&lt;A&gt; instance.\nIt is through the Address&lt;A&gt; of an actor A that any part of the system can communicate with the actor.\nAll methods upon Address&lt;A&gt; are immutable, and the addresses can be freely clone()'d and shared around.\nAs noted above, there are two types of message interactions possible with an actor through it's Address&lt;A&gt;:\nNotify\npub fn notify&lt;M&gt;(&amp;self, message: M)\nwhere\n    A: NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; + 'static,\n    M: 'static,\n{\n    ... elided ...\n}\n\nThis signature demonstrates a few points:\n\nThe system is ultimately 'static-centric.\nYou can send a message M if the underlying Actor implements the NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; trait.\n\nA notify(...) is a non-blocking synchronous call, meaning that it won't stop the processing and it can be called from any context, sync or async.\nIt ultimately enqueues the message into a FIFO for the actor. \nSome systems refer to this FIFO as the actor's \"inbox\".\nMessages in the FIFO are indeed processed in a first-in-first-out order.\nThis also means that the message is not processed immediately upon the call of notify(...).\nThis gives this method fire and forget semantics.\nThe actor will be mostly (see NB below)  guaranteed to eventually process the notification, at some point in the future.\nNB: Currently the FIFO is set to a depth of 16, and if it overflows messages will be silently discarded.\nWe understand this is sub-optimal. \nThe intention is that once const generics are available in stable Rust we will allow per-actor queue depth configuration.\nAdditionally, we are considering how different overflow strategies may be applied per-actor.\nOn the Actor side, processing is handled through an implementation of the NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; trait, for each type of message that is considered acceptable:\npub struct On;\npub struct Off;\n\nimpl&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;On&gt; for SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;\nwhere\n    P: OutputPin,\n    A: ActiveOutput,\n{\n    fn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: On) -&gt; Completion {\n        ... elided ...\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;Off&gt; for SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;\nwhere\n    P: OutputPin,\n    A: ActiveOutput,\n{\n    fn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: Off) -&gt; Completion {\n        ... elided ...\n    }\n}\n\nRequest\nSometimes it's useful to have a somewhat synchronous interactino with an actor in an request/response type of cycle.\nThe Address&lt;A&gt; type also provides that capability:\npub async fn request&lt;M&gt;(&amp;self, message: M) -&gt; &lt;A as RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;&gt;::Response\nwhere\n    A: RequestHandler&lt;M&gt; + 'static,\n    M: 'static,\n{\n    ... elided ...\n}\n\nThe first thing to note is that because Address&lt;A&gt; is a type and not a trait, it can indeed support async methods.\nThe second thing to note is that request(...) is an async method.\nUpon calling this method, a Future is ultimately returned, and the called must .await the response, per usual Rust async semantics.\nIt is the async nature of this method that allows actors to talk to other actors and remain non-blocking and cooperatively schedulable.\nAs with the notify(...) method, this method is also considered immutable, and uses the underlying actor's FIFO.\nThe same FIFO is shared between all types of messages that an actor can be notified or requested.\nOn the Actor side, as with the NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;, there is a RequestHandler&lt;M&gt; trait to be implemented for each type of request an actor needs to be able to handle.\npub struct Lock;\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; RequestHandler&lt;Lock&gt; for Mutex&lt;T&gt;\nwhere\n    T: 'static,\n{\n    type Response = Exclusive&lt;T&gt;;\n\n    fn on_request(&amp;'static mut self, message: Lock) -&gt; Response&lt;Self::Response&gt; {\n        ... elided ...\n    }\n}\n\nInterrupt Actors\nExtending on the Plain Ol' Actors are Interrupt actors, which in addition to doing all the things an actor can do, also is cognizant and connected to hardware interrupts.\nInterrupts are special, because they can arrive at any time, and they are not initiated as a message from another actor.\nSo interrupts are treated somewhat specially.\nAn interrupt firing can be considered a special type of message, without content. \nTo that end, the Interrupt trait brings one more method to implement: on_interrupt(...):\nimpl&lt;D, PIN&gt; Interrupt for Button&lt;D, PIN&gt;\nwhere\n    D: Device + EventHandler&lt;ButtonEvent&gt; + 'static,\n    PIN: InputPin + ExtiPin,\n{\n    fn on_interrupt(&amp;mut self) {\n        ... elided ...\n    }\n}\n\nMessage-handling and async\nSince Drogue Device attempts to provide guardrails for performing asynchronous operations where possible, but Rust doesn't currently support async in traits,\nyou may have noticed that all of the aforementioned NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; and RequestHandler&lt;M&gt; methods were not, at all, async.\nAdditionally, their return value in the signatures may have appeared slightly odd.\nAlso, each method takes a &amp;'static mut self reference. \nIt's `static because the system is static, and Futures work best with `static`. \nIt's &amp;mut because the scheduler guarantees that the actor's methods are serialized and ensures that a given handler is the only reference (mutable or not) \nfor the actor at any given point in time.\nThis allows the actor to free, without locks, mutate his own state.\non_notify\nLet's look at the fire-and-forget NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; on an actor.\nfn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: M) -&gt; Completion;\n\nEven though Address&lt;A&gt;::notify(...) returns nothing, the handler implemented on the actor must return a Completion, which is where the opportunity to perform asynchronous\nprocessing arrives.\nIf the processing is quick and non-blocking, a simple implementation can do whatever work it needs to do and return Completion::Immediate to signal \nthat the message was immediately processed to completion. \nAn ::immediate() function is provided to create a Completion::Immediate for the return value.\nfn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: M) -&gt; Completion {\n    self.counter += 1;\n    Completion::immediate()\n}\n\nIf in response to a message an actor needs to perform some other action, such as making an async request to another actor, a Completion::Defer(...) is available,\nwhich ultimately wraps an async block.\nThe executor will attempt to avoid a context-switch and begin executing the returned async block as far as possible before swapping to another task.\nA ::defer(...) function is provided to create a Completion::Defer(...) for the return value.\nfn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: M) -&gt; Completion {\n    Completion::defer( async move {\n        self.counter += self.other_actor.request( SomeMessage ).await;\n    })\n}\n\non_request\nAs with on_notify, the on_request(...) method also takes the same flavor of &amp;'static mut self and provides both an immediate and defer variant of Response&lt;T&gt;, but allow for the\nreturn-value as specified in the associated type of RequestHandler.\nAn immediate response is allowed if async is not required:\nfn on_request(&amp;'static mut self, message: M) -&gt; Response&lt;Self::Response&gt; {\n    Response::immediate(42)\n}\n\nIf an async block is needed:\nfn on_request(&amp;'static mut self, message: M) -&gt; Response&lt;Self::Response&gt; {\n    Response::defer( async move {\n        let response = self.some_other_actor.rqeuest( AnotherMessage ).await;\n        response.favorite_cheese\n    } )\n}\n\non_interrupt\nFor actors that also implement Interrupt, their on_interrupt(...) method may be called when the associated interrupt fires.\nSince interrupts must return quickly, this is a simple, normal, non-async method without opportunity of deferring to an async block:\nfn on_interrupt(&amp;mut self) {\n    self.some_other_actor.notify( SomethingHappened );\n}\n\nThis also implies that Interrupt implementations can only use notify(...) on other actors, and not make asynchronous request(...)\ncalls.\nGeneral async Executor\nThere isn't one.\nDrogue Device explicitly does not support arbitrary spawn(...)ing of async blocks.\nAll asynchronous activity takes place through coordination of actors and their FIFO queues.\nThere is an async executor, you're just not allowed to touch it directly.\nWiring it all together\nSo far we've explored the various actor, address, message-handlers and async aspects, so let's now examine how we connect it all together.\nThe Device\nAt the root of an actor system is a Device. \nThis is a user-constructed type that ultimately ends up holding all of the other Actor and Interrupts, but indirectly.\nWhen the system is started, the entire tree, from the Device on down is moved into a 'static context, which is how\nall of the message-handlers end up taking a &amp;'static mut self. \nThis example will use an STM32 B-L4S5I-IOT01A board, but the same principals apply to others, even if the pinout is different.\nThe Type\nFor ease, a simple type with public members can be defines. \nSince nothing should actually hold an Actor directly, each Actor or Interrupt is ultimately held in a matching context.\nType aliases have been used to simplify the signatures since generics are quite prevalent.\nAn actor has been specified for each of the two LEDs on this board, along with an interrupt actor for the button.\nAdditionally, two Blinker actors and a timer actor are also specified.\nSince hardware timers are interrupt-driven, it is an interrupt actor.\npub struct MyDevice {\n    pub ld1: ActorContext&lt;Ld1Actor&gt;,\n    pub ld2: ActorContext&lt;Ld2Actor&gt;,\n    pub blinker1: ActorContext&lt;Blinker1Actor&gt;,\n    pub blinker2: ActorContext&lt;Blinker2Actor&gt;,\n    pub button: InterruptContext&lt;ButtonInterrupt&gt;,\n    pub timer: InterruptContext&lt;TimerActor&gt;,\n}\n\nThe Device Implementation\nA single method is required when implementing Device: mount(...).\nWhen the system is started, the device will be automatically mounted into it. \nSince the device holds the other actors and interrupts, it must propagate the mount down to the children in order to activate them within the system also.\nUpon mounting each child, its Address&lt;A&gt; will be returned.\nEach Actor can optionally implement a Bind&lt;OTHER_ACTOR:Actor&gt; method to have a way to inject another actor's Address&lt;A&gt; into it.\nThis is one way inform an actor of another actor during the mount(...) cycle.\nimpl Device for MyDevice {\n    fn mount(\n        &amp;'static mut self,\n        bus_address: &amp;Address&lt;EventBus&lt;Self&gt;&gt;,\n        supervisor: &amp;mut Supervisor,\n    ) {\n        let ld1_addr = self.ld1.mount(supervisor);\n        let ld2_addr = self.ld2.mount(supervisor);\n\n        let blinker1_addr = self.blinker1.mount(supervisor);\n        let blinker2_addr = self.blinker2.mount(supervisor);\n\n        let timer_addr = self.timer.mount(supervisor);\n\n        blinker1_addr.bind(&amp;timer_addr);\n        blinker1_addr.bind(&amp;ld1_addr);\n\n        blinker2_addr.bind(&amp;timer_addr);\n        blinker2_addr.bind(&amp;ld2_addr);\n\n        let button_addr = self.button.mount(supervisor);\n        button_addr.bind(bus_address);\n    }\n}\n\nIn the code above, each Blinker actor gets bind(...) called twice: once for the LED it needs to blink, and once for the shared Timer.\nThe Button actor gets bound to the address of the EventBus which we will touch on later.\nThe Setup\nUsing bare-metal Rust, we set up the actors and the device in a normal #[entry]:\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    rtt_init_print!();\n    log::set_logger(&amp;LOGGER).unwrap();\n    log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Debug);\n\n    let mut device = Peripherals::take().unwrap();\n\n    log::info!(\"[main] Initializing\");\n    let mut flash = device.FLASH.constrain();\n    let mut rcc = device.RCC.constrain();\n    let mut pwr = device.PWR.constrain(&amp;mut rcc.apb1r1);\n    let clocks = rcc\n        .cfgr\n        .sysclk(80.mhz())\n        .pclk1(80.mhz())\n        .pclk2(80.mhz())\n        .freeze(&amp;mut flash.acr, &amp;mut pwr);\n\n    let mut gpioa = device.GPIOA.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n    let mut gpiob = device.GPIOB.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n    let mut gpioc = device.GPIOC.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n    let mut gpiod = device.GPIOD.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n\n    // == LEDs ==\n\n    let ld1 = gpioa\n        .pa5\n        .into_push_pull_output(&amp;mut gpioa.moder, &amp;mut gpioa.otyper);\n\n    let ld1 = SimpleLED::new(ld1, Active::High);\n\n    let ld2 = gpiob\n        .pb14\n        .into_push_pull_output(&amp;mut gpiob.moder, &amp;mut gpiob.otyper);\n\n    let ld2 = SimpleLED::new(ld2, Active::High);\n\n    // == Blinker ==\n\n    let blinker1 = Blinker::new(Milliseconds(500u32));\n    let blinker2 = Blinker::new(Milliseconds(1000u32));\n\n    // == Button ==\n\n    let mut button = gpioc\n        .pc13\n        .into_pull_up_input(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.pupdr);\n\n    button.make_interrupt_source(&amp;mut device.SYSCFG, &amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n    button.enable_interrupt(&amp;mut device.EXTI);\n    button.trigger_on_edge(&amp;mut device.EXTI, Edge::RISING_FALLING);\n\n    let button = Button::new(button, Active::Low);\n\n    // == Timer ==\n\n    let mcu_timer = McuTimer::tim15(device.TIM15, clocks, &amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n    let timer = Timer::new(mcu_timer);\n\n    // == Device ==\n\n    let device = MyDevice {\n        ld1: ActorContext::new(ld1).with_name(\"ld1\"),\n        ld2: ActorContext::new(ld2).with_name(\"ld2\"),\n        blinker1: ActorContext::new(blinker1).with_name(\"blinker1\"),\n        blinker2: ActorContext::new(blinker2).with_name(\"blinker2\"),\n        button: InterruptContext::new(button, EXTI15_10).with_name(\"button\"),\n        timer: InterruptContext::new(timer, TIM15).with_name(\"timer\"),\n    };\n\n    device!( MyDevice = device; 1024 );\n}\n\nEach actor is directly constructed and configured within the #[entry], wrapped in the appropriate context and attached to the device.\nYou will notice that InterruptContext::new(...) also takes an IRQ to be connected to the underlying actor.\nWhen the associate interrupt fires, the actor's on_interrupt(...) will be triggered.\nOptionally, each context can be associated with a name, which can make debugging or logging easier in a multi-actor system, particular\nwhen working with several actors of the same type.\nThe device!(...) magic\nThe last line of the #[entry] specifies the type implementing Device, the device itself, plus the size of memory to reserve for\nasynchronous book-keeping. In this case, 1024 bytes is allotted.\nThe device!(...) macro never returns and is a suitable last line for #[entry].\nAt this point, the system is running.\nExplore the Example\nAll of the example actors in our system are part of the drogue-device crate.\nLEDs\nEach LED is a SimpleLED actor, which is parameterized by the appropriate digital OutputPin and an Active state which describes if it's active-high or active-low.\nEach LED can handle a notification of simple On or Off messages:\nimpl&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;On&gt; for SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;\nwhere\n    P: OutputPin,\n    A: ActiveOutput,\n{\n    fn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: On) -&gt; Completion {\n        self.turn_on();\n        Completion::immediate()\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;Off&gt; for SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;\nwhere\n    P: OutputPin,\n    A: ActiveOutput,\n{\n    fn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: Off) -&gt; Completion {\n        Completion::defer(async move {\n            self.turn_off();\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nMagic with Address&lt;SimpleLED&lt;...&gt;&gt;\nSince the SimpleLED is implemented within the drogue-device crate, along with Address, we can actually extend Address&lt;SimpleLED&lt;...&gt;&gt; to provide handy API methods.\nimpl&lt;S&gt; Address&lt;S&gt;\nwhere\n    S: NotifyHandler&lt;Off&gt; + NotifyHandler&lt;On&gt;,\n    S: Actor + 'static,\n{\n    pub fn turn_on(&amp;self) {\n        self.notify(On);\n    }\n\n    pub fn turn_off(&amp;self) {\n        self.notify(Off);\n    }\n}\n\nNow, anyone holding an Address&lt;SimpleLED&lt;...&gt;&gt; does not even have to think in terms of notify(On) or notify(Off), but can directly call turn_on() and turn_off().\nTimer\nThe Timer actor was constructed using a hardware timer of our platform, and wired to the appropriate interrupt.\nThe timer is a shared resource, capable of providing asynchronous delays or scheduling future delivery of messages.\nSince an asychronous delay is asynchronous and must be awaited, it is implemented as a RequestHandler&lt;Delay&lt;...&gt;&gt;.\nimpl&lt;T: HalTimer, DUR: Duration + Into&lt;Milliseconds&gt;&gt; RequestHandler&lt;Delay&lt;DUR&gt;&gt; for Timer&lt;T&gt; {\n    type Response = ();\n\n    fn on_request(&amp;'static mut self, message: Delay&lt;DUR&gt;) -&gt; Response&lt;Self::Response&gt; {\n        ... elided ...\n    }\n}\n\nThe request has no meaningful response type, but the .await from the caller will only return once the delay has expired.\nWe'll be using the Schedule message type, which simply asks the timer to deliver, via notify(...) some message to some address at some point in the future.\nimpl&lt;T, E, A, DUR&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;Schedule&lt;A, DUR, E&gt;&gt; for Timer&lt;T&gt;\nwhere\n    T: HalTimer,\n    E: Clone + 'static,\n    A: Actor + NotifyHandler&lt;E&gt; + 'static,\n    DUR: Duration + Into&lt;Milliseconds&gt; + 'static,\n{\n    fn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: Schedule&lt;A, DUR, E&gt;) -&gt; Completion {\n        ... elided ...\n    }\n} \n\nBlinker\nIf you recall, our Blinker was bound to both the LED and the timer.\nSince its own address, along with that of the LED and Timer are not known at construction time, it has Option&lt;Address&lt;...&gt;&gt; fields for populating later, during start-up or via bind(...) calls.\npub struct Blinker&lt;S, T&gt;\nwhere\n    S: Switchable,\n    T: HalTimer,\n{\n    led: Option&lt;Address&lt;S&gt;&gt;,\n    timer: Option&lt;Address&lt;Timer&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n    address: Option&lt;Address&lt;Self&gt;&gt;,\n    delay: Milliseconds,\n}\n\nThe Blinker implements some methods on the Actor trait which allow it to learn of its own Address and to perform some action at start-up.\nIn this case, it schedules a message of State::On back to itself after delay milliseconds when it starts.\nimpl&lt;S, T&gt; Actor for Blinker&lt;S, T&gt;\nwhere\n    S: Switchable,\n    T: HalTimer,\n{\n    fn mount(&amp;mut self, address: Address&lt;Self&gt;)\n    where\n        Self: Sized,\n    {\n        self.address.replace(address);\n    }\n\n    fn start(&amp;'static mut self) -&gt; Completion {\n        self.timer.as_ref().unwrap().schedule(\n            self.delay,\n            State::On,\n            self.address.as_ref().unwrap().clone(),\n        );\n        Completion::immediate()\n    }\n}\n\nWhen the timer delivers that future-scheduled message, it will take action on it, and scheduler another message to itself to get a blinking LED, toggling forever.\nimpl&lt;S, T&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;State&gt; for Blinker&lt;S, T&gt;\nwhere\n    S: Switchable,\n    T: HalTimer,\n{\n    fn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: State) -&gt; Completion {\n        match message {\n            State::On =&gt; {\n                self.led.as_ref().unwrap().turn_on();\n                self.timer.as_ref().unwrap().schedule(\n                    self.delay,\n                    State::Off,\n                    self.address.as_ref().unwrap().clone(),\n                );\n            }\n            State::Off =&gt; {\n                self.led.as_ref().unwrap().turn_off();\n                self.timer.as_ref().unwrap().schedule(\n                    self.delay,\n                    State::On,\n                    self.address.as_ref().unwrap().clone(),\n                );\n            }\n        }\n        Completion::immediate()\n    }\n}\n\nWe also can envision wanting to change the speed of the blinking during the course of the system running, so we provide a NotifyHandler&lt;AdjustDelay&gt; to the Blinker:\npub struct AdjustDelay(Milliseconds);\n\nimpl&lt;S, T&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;AdjustDelay&gt; for Blinker&lt;S, T&gt;\nwhere\n    S: Switchable,\n    T: HalTimer,\n{\n    fn on_notify(&amp;'static mut self, message: AdjustDelay) -&gt; Completion {\n        self.delay = message.0;\n        Completion::immediate()\n    }\n}\n\nOnce again, also, we add some fluent API to instances of Address&lt;Blinker&lt;...&gt;:\nimpl&lt;S, T&gt; Address&lt;Blinker&lt;S, T&gt;&gt;\nwhere\n    Self: 'static,\n    S: Switchable,\n    T: HalTimer,\n{\n    pub fn adjust_delay(&amp;self, delay: Milliseconds) {\n        self.notify(AdjustDelay(delay))\n    }\n}\n\nButton (and the EventBus)\nThe Button is an interrupt-based actor. While we could have used bind(...) to target a specific recipient of its ButtonEvent::Pressed or ButtonEvent::Released messages, \nthat would have tightly-bound the target to the semantics of the button.\nInstead, the Button is bound to the Address&lt;EventBus&lt;...&gt;&gt; during the Device mount, in order to delegate what action to take to a loosely-coupled actor.\npub struct Button&lt;D: Device, PIN&gt; {\n    pin: PIN,\n    active: Active,\n    bus: Option&lt;Address&lt;EventBus&lt;D&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;D, PIN&gt; Bind&lt;EventBus&lt;D&gt;&gt; for Button&lt;D, PIN&gt;\nwhere\n    D: Device,\n{\n    fn on_bind(&amp;'static mut self, address: Address&lt;EventBus&lt;D&gt;&gt;) {\n        self.bus.replace(address);\n    }\n}\n\n\nWhen the interrupt fires, its on_interrupt(...) method is invoked, where it calls notify(...) on the EventBus&lt;...&gt; address.\nimpl&lt;D, PIN&gt; Interrupt for Button&lt;D, PIN&gt;\nwhere\n    D: Device + EventHandler&lt;ButtonEvent&gt; + 'static,\n    PIN: InputPin + ExtiPin,\n{\n    fn on_interrupt(&amp;mut self) {\n        if self.pin.check_interrupt() {\n            match self.active {\n                Active::High =&gt; {\n                    if self.pin.is_high().ok().unwrap() {\n                        self.bus\n                            .as_ref()\n                            .unwrap()\n                            .publish(ButtonEvent::Pressed);\n                    } else {\n                        self.bus\n                            .as_ref()\n                            .unwrap()\n                            .publish(ButtonEvent::Released);\n                    }\n                }\n                Active::Low =&gt; {\n                    if self.pin.is_low().ok().unwrap() {\n                        self.bus\n                            .as_ref()\n                            .unwrap()\n                            .publish(ButtonEvent::Pressed);\n                    } else {\n                        self.bus\n                            .as_ref()\n                            .unwrap()\n                            .publish(ButtonEvent::Released);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            self.pin.clear_interrupt_pending_bit();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhat is the EventBus?\nSo far we've glossed over the EventBus. \nThe EventBus is your device. \nYour device provides all logic for what happens to messages sent to the EventBus address, in order to apply application semantics.\nJust as actors and interrupts can implement NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; and RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;, your Device can (and must) implement EventHandler&lt;M&gt; for all events destined to the EventBus.\nimpl EventHandler&lt;ButtonEvent&gt; for MyDevice {\n    fn on_event(&amp;'static mut self, message: ButtonEvent)\n    where\n        Self: Sized,\n    {\n        match message {\n            ButtonEvent::Pressed =&gt; {\n                log::info!(\"[{}] button pressed\", ActorInfo::name());\n                self.blinker1.address().adjust_delay(Milliseconds(100u32));\n            }\n            ButtonEvent::Released =&gt; {\n                log::info!(\"[{}] button released\", ActorInfo::name());\n                self.blinker1.address().adjust_delay(Milliseconds(500u32));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSince your Device maintains the contexts for each component, it can obtain the address for each, and send notifications down the line.\nIn this case, when the button is pressed, our Device translates that into adjusting the delay for the Blinker that controls LED 1.\nUpon releasing the button, it re-adjusts the delay.\nThe end result is pressing the button speeds up the blinking until the button is released.\nAnd the button is ignorant of the LED, and the LED is ignorant of the button. \nYou device provides the glue between two disparate component message semantics.\nOther Bits in the Tin\nWhile LEDs and Buttons are nice, drogue-device also provides within the crate concurrency actors, such as Mutext&lt;T&gt; and Semaphore.\nAdditionally, Ulf has recently worked on UART support that does not require 'static messages.\nWe also aim to include device drivers directly in-tree.\nFuture directions\nThere's a lot of work left to do, much of which will be bringing significantly more async support to various MCUs and HALs.\nThere is probably a lot of API clean-up that can be done, in order to make implementing actors easier.\nWe mentioned way way earlier, we intend to make each actor's FIFO more configurable to allow for more tailored overflow behaviour.\nBeing able to dynamically adjust the priority of the async tasks is also a goal.\nWe welcome any and all contributions to the project.

But sometimes, you just want to have an easy getting started experience, to reduce turnaround time when testing changes to Drogue Cloud itself, or for running in environments where Kubernetes is not available.\nRead on to learn how you can run Drogue Cloud standalone.\nUse cases\nThe primary use cases we envision for running Drogue Cloud Server are the following:\n\nLocal development - building and running a local instance while developing new features in Drogue Cloud.\nLocal testing - having an instance of Drogue Cloud available locally to test applications.\nTraining and evaluation - getting a Drogue Cloud instance running immediately for trying it out.\nRunning on devices without Kubernetes support - running on more constrainted devices where Kubernetes cannot run or architectures not supported by Kubernetes.\n\nThere are some limitations as well, particularily when doing a production deployment:\n\nIt does not provide a production ready and fully secure out of the box installation.\nScaling the services must be done manually and by running multiple instances and assigning roles - something the existing Kubernetes-based installation helps you with already\nNot all Drogue Cloud services are available (more on this later).\n\nAppreciating Kubernetes\nDrogue Cloud on Kubernetes automatically installs some dependencies of Drogue Cloud such as:\n\nPostgreSQL\nKeycloak\nKafka\n\nHowever, running outside of Kubernetes also means that you need to run or configure these services yourself. You can do this by installing the software manually and ensuring they are accessible locally. You can also rely on (tada!) containers using docker-compose or podman-compose if it is available on your platform, and we provide a compose file just for that purpose.\nInstalling The Binary\nOne of the goals with running Drogue Cloud locally was to encapsulate the functionality in a single binary, drogue-cloud-server. You can build it yourself, or you can download prebuilt binaries for your platform.\nRunning\nOnce installed, it's time to run. You can find the detailed instructions in the book. It's important to note that by default, the Kafka, Keycloak and PostgreSQL instance must be reachable on localhost where the server is running.\nOnce you have the dependencies running, we can start the server:\n./drogue-cloud-server run --enable-all\n\nWhen starting, the server will perform the following steps (in order):\n\nConnect to PostgreSQL and run schema migration\nConnect to Keycloak and create an OIDC client\nLaunch the services specified for the run command\n\nUsing --enable-all will run all Drogue Cloud services supported. At the time of writing, this is:\n\nREST API\nDevice registry\nDevice authentication\nUser authentication\nHTTP endpoint\nMQTT endpoint\nMQTT integration (for applications consuming telemetry data and sending commands)\n\nWe plan to expose all the Drogue Cloud services.\nThe server will print some info to the terminal on how to log into the server using the drg client, creating applications and devices, and publishing telemtry data:\n$ drogue-cloud-server run --enable-all\nMigrating database schema...\nMigrating database schema... done!\nConfiguring keycloak... done!\nDrogue Cloud is running!\n\nEndpoints:\n        API:     http://localhost:10001\n        HTTP:    http://localhost:8088\n        MQTT:    mqtt://localhost:1883\n\nKeycloak Credentials:\n        User: admin\n        Password: admin123456\n\nLogging in:\n        drg login http://localhost:10001\n\nCreating an application:\n        drg create app example-app\n\nCreating a device:\n        drg create device --app example-app device1 --spec '{\"credentials\":{\"credentials\":[{\"pass\":\"hey-rodney\"}]}}'\n\nPublishing data to the HTTP endpoint:\n        curl -u 'device1@example-app:hey-rodney' -d '{\"temp\": 42}' -v -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST http://localhost:8088/v1/foo\n\nOther options\nThe server can also be run with other options, we'll quickly cover the most important:\n\n--server-cert and --server-key - enable TLS for the endpoints. Both arguments should refer to PEM-encoded files.\n--bind-address - bind to a different network interface (uses localhost by default).\n\nRunning with TLS\nTo enable TLS, we must generate a certificate to use with the service first. To create certificates that are more easily consumed by embedded devices, we'll make an elliptic curve based certificate:\n# Generating CA key\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ca-key-ec.pem\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in ca-key-ec.pem -out ca-key.pem\n\n# Generating CA cert\nopenssl req -x509 -new -SHA256 -nodes -key ca-key.pem -days 3650 -out ca-cert.pem -batch\n\n# Generating server key\nopenssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out server-key-ec.pem\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in server-key-ec.pem -out server-key.pem\n\n# Generating server cert\nopenssl req -new -SHA256 -key server-key.pem -addext \"subjectAltName = DNS:localhost\" -subj \"/CN=localhost\" -nodes -out server.csr -batch\nopenssl x509 -req -SHA256 -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem\n\nYou can now start the server with TLS enabled:\n$ drogue-cloud-server run --enable-all --server-cert server-cert.pem --server-key server-key.pem\n\nConnecting from Drogue Device\nWith the server running, we can now test it. If you have the hardware, there is already a lot of examples that will work with the server out of the box (just point them to the correct IP of your server). \nIf you don't have any microcontroller hardware, don't worry! We've got you covered with the std cloud example that runs out of the box on any Linux/Mac OS X/Windows.\nYou need to specify the device username and password in the example configuration (see the README for the example), edit the expected IP and port of your server instance, and run.\nThe output should look something like this when running the PC example:\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling cloud v0.1.0 (/home/lulf/dev/drogue-iot/drogue-device/examples/std/cloud)\n    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.39s\n     Running `/home/lulf/dev/drogue-iot/drogue-device/examples/std/target/debug/cloud`\n[2021-11-03T13:17:52.263210627Z INFO  drogue_temperature] Sending temperature measurement\n[2021-11-03T13:17:52.263368651Z INFO  drogue_device::clients::http] Connected to 127.0.0.1:8088\n[2021-11-03T13:17:52.272848575Z INFO  drogue_temperature] Response status: Accepted\n[2021-11-03T13:17:52.272879316Z INFO  drogue_temperature] No response body\n\nSummary\nWe have seen how you can get up and running with Drogue Cloud running on bare metal using a single binary. This enables quicker turneround times when developing Drogue Cloud, but also paves the way for running Drogue Cloud in more environments. Finally, we've seen examples of using Drogue Device applications to connect.\nFuture work is to expose more Drogue Cloud services such as the CoAP endpoint, and Websocket integration services. Enabling the server to work with externally hosted PostgreSQL, Kafka and Keycloak would also be interesting.\nIf you'd like to help out in these areas, join our community!\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-server/","title":"Introducing Drogue Cloud Server"},"https://blog.drogue.io/lorawan-update/":{"body":"Earlier we've seen examples of drogue device using LoRaWAN using an STM32 discovery board. Since then, the hardware support in the community has improved even more.\n\nThere are multiple efforts within Rust Embedded to improve LoRaWAN support. This post will walk through the state of the ecosystem and introduce some of the crates being worked on, and some updates from Embassy and Drogue Device.\nImproved hardware support\nThe LoRaWAN capable hardware is dominated by Semtech-based radios. The Sx127x family of radios have been the most common in the development kits, with an SPI interface for accessing the radio state. This radio is well supported in Rust, and there are several crates for accessing it, such as sx127x_lora and radio-sx127x. Drogue uses a variant of the first for its async sx127x driver.\nThe Sx126x family of radios, which is a more power efficient and has a smaller footprint, seems to be used in newer designs. This is also used in the STM32WL family of chips in a System on Chip (SoC) fashion, using a special SPI peripheral for accessing it. Recently, there have been efforts to add support for these chips in the stm32wl-hal crate, from which the implementation in Embassy is based. The STM32WL chip is also used in the new Generic Node sensor from The Things Industries (TTI). Since Drogue Device is based on Embassy, the radio peripheral can be used with this chip there as well.\nThere are also standalone Sx126x radios on several development kits, and the sx126x crate supports these standalone radios.\nThe link layer\nAlthough having radio support in the various HALs are great, that will only get you as far as sending radio packets. To operate in a LoRaWAN network, an implementation of the medium access control (MAC) layer is needed. The rust-lorawan crate implements a LoRaWAN compliant MAC layer, and allows plugging in any radio peripheral. Drogue Device have been using this crate for a long time, with an out of the box integration for sx127x based radios, demonstrated by the STM32 LoRa Discovery Board. The crate(s) are maintained by Ivaylo Petrov and Louis Thiery.\nFor the new STM32WL-based chips, there are different examples depending on if you use async or not. With the new stm32wl-hal, the lorawan-wl example was created by Jorge Iglesias Garcia, and it integrates the STM32WL radio with rust-lorawan. Thanks to this, with debugging help from Jorge, Drogue Device now also has an example based on the Embassy HAL.\nNew developments in the link layer is defmt support from Jorge, performance enhancements12 from yours truly, and initial discusisons on introducing an async radio interface, allowing async-await to be used all the way.\nEmbassy\nEmbassy aims to be an async runtime for embedded Rust, which we've covered in an earlier post. Since then, the community set out to build a new PAC (Peripheral Access Crate) for STM32, named stm32-metapac, that can be used both by Embassy and other HALs. The PAC relies on generating code for specific chip variants at compile time using cargo features. The code is generated based on a chip definition, which is in turn derived from the STM32 CubeDB XML, C header files and SVD files. Adding support for new chips can be as easy as adding it to a list of chip families that it should support, and if you're lucky, register definitions for the peripherals already exists.\nOn top of stm32-metapac lies embassy-stm32, which is an async HAL using the generated metapac underneath. This is a \"unified\" HAL that aims to work with any STM32 chip that can be generated by stm32-metapac. The existing HALsfor STM32 are written per chip family, which cause them to suffer from duplication and a corresponding higher maintenance load. The way the unified approach works is that STM32 peripherals are versioned (SPI v1, SPI v2, GPIO v1 etc.), and reused in different chip families. The HAL therefore only needs to implement access to peripherals of a given version, and will automatically work with multiple chip families that are using that version of the peripheral. This reduces the amount of duplication since features are gated by peripheral versions rather than chip family.\nAnother enhancement that landed in Embassy is an async MPSC (Multiple Producer Single Consumer) implementation from Christopher Hunt, which has now replaced the channel implementation in Drogue Device as well. This makes for a great communication channel between Embassy tasks.\nDrogue Device\nDrogue Device have changed slightly to simplify it's Actor model even further. Instead of requiring an Actor to implement both an on_mount, on_start and on_message methods, now only an on_mount method, which is handed an Inbox to pull messages from. This greatly simplifies actor implementations. Lets say you have a shared counter that you want to make an actor for:\npub struct Counter {\n    count: u32,\n}\npub struct Increment;\n\nIn earlier versions you would implement an Actor this way:\nimpl Actor for Counter {\n    type Message&lt;'a&gt; = Increment;\n    fn on_mount(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Configuration, _: Address&lt;'static, Self&gt;) { }\n\n    type OnStartFuture&lt;'m&gt; = impl core::future::Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'm;\n    fn on_start&lt;'m&gt;(&amp;'m mut self) -&gt; Self::OnStartFuture&lt;'m&gt; {\n        async move {\n            self.count = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    type OnMessageFuture&lt;'m&gt; = impl core::future::Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'm;\n    fn on_message&lt;'m&gt;(&amp;'m mut self, message: Self::Message&lt;'m&gt;) -&gt; Self::OnMessageFuture&lt;'m&gt; {\n        async move {\n            self.count += 0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAfter the restructuring, the API is now changed to this:\nimpl Actor for Counter {\n    type Message&lt;'a&gt; = Increment;\n\n    type OnMountFuture&lt;'a&gt; = impl core::future::Future&lt;Output = ()&gt; + 'a;\n\n    fn on_mount&lt;'m, M&gt;(\n        &amp;'m mut self,\n        _: Self::Configuration,\n        _: Address&lt;'static, Self&gt;,\n        inbox: &amp;'m mut M,\n    ) -&gt; Self::OnMountFuture&lt;'m, M&gt;\n    where\n        M: Inbox&lt;'m, Self&gt; + 'm;\n    {\n        async move {\n            self.count = 0;\n            loop {\n                if let Some(m) = inbox.next().await {\n                    self.count += 1;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis reduces the number of types and methods an actor has to implement, and allows for another use case that wasn't possible before: selecting an action based on awaiting the arrival of a new message or some timeout, which removes the need for using a Timer or Ticker actor for this type of behavior.\nNew LoRaWAN examples\nAs mentioned earlier, the set of examples for LoRaWAN have now also expanded:\n\nRAK811 - STM32 L1 + Semtech Sx1276 radio\nSTM32WL - STM32WL with builtin Semtech Sx126x radio \n\nThese in combination of the existing examples, cover some of the most popular devices used for LoRaWAN sensors.\nFuture work\nIs LoRaWAN support done yet? No :) In an evolving world there are always new hardware and new standards to support. However, it is also time to take a step back and ensure other parts of Drogue Device is also improving. \nA LoRaWAN improvement that's in the works is to introduce an async version of the MAC implementation in rust-lorawan, which in turn can define async radio traits that fully make use of the async capabilities in the Embassy HAL.\nA WiFi-based workshop is also in the works, which will make use of the STM32L4 IoT Discovery Kit, thereby adding support for the eS-WiFi driver.\nFinally, we want to provide more examples using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is already well supported in Embassy.\nSummary\nWe've seen how the different LoRa radios are improving their support in the Rust ecosystem. Moreover, Embassy and Drogue Device are taking advantage of this and providing new examples.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/lorawan-update/","title":"State of LoRaWAN support"},"https://blog.drogue.io/matter-of-time/":{"body":"In the embedded world, quite often you don't have a wall clock sort of clock. \nYou may have something that can reckon the passage of time, though. \nThe various current solutions for managing time within embedded Rust has yet to be completely abstracted.\nWe leverage some up-and-coming libraries to help paper over the differences.\nTime keeps on slipping... into the future...\nWhen you're doing embedded Rust, sometimes you want to know how much time has passed, and sometimes you want to pause for some amount of time.\nThe embedded-hal provides two useful types of traits:\n\nDelays\nTimers\n\nA delay provides a blocking operation which pauses execution for some amount of time.\nA timer allows you to know when some amount of time has elapsed.\nAt least using my current board, based on the STM32L4 family, the HAL provides exactly 1 delay, but a large handful of timers.\nWhy is this important?\nI'm trying to interface over SPI to yet-another WiFi-offload board.\nThis board, like many, needs certain pins raised and lowered. \nIt also needs you to wait a few milliseconds after raising or lowering the pin before you assume the board has dealt with the change.\nRoughly:\n\nLower pin, signalling you are about to send some data.\nWait 10 milliseconds.\nSend some data.\nRaise the pin signalling you are done sending data.\n\nOne Delay, Multiple Timers\nAs noted, often you might find yourself in an environment that only has one available Delay.\nAnd if your environment is RTIC, the framework itself may take the delay facilities for its own software task scheduling, leaving you with zero.\nAdd to that multiple drivers that need to be able to delay every now and then, and you find yourself in a precarious situation.\nNo unified concept of time\nThe various HALs may define their own time structures, their timers might work in terms of milliseconds or hertz, and in general\nit's quite difficult to write any device driver that can have assurances of how time is managed and recorded.\nEnter embedded-time and drogue-embedded-timer\nembedded-time\nPeter Taylor has been trying to create a unified view of time for the embedded world, suitable called embedded-time.\nIt provides everything you could hope for in terms of units-of-time, duration and instance measurements, and conversions into/from rates.\nIt does not provide bindings to hardware.\ndrogue-embedded-timer\nThe drogue-embedded-timer library attempts to provide directly-usable bindings of\nPeter's embedded-time library to the embedded Rust HAL-centric world.\nClocks\nAt the bottom of the stack is an embedded-time Clock, which is a software device to measure the passage of time.\nIt may have an arbitrary amount of precision, marking off individual microseconds, dozens of milliseconds, or entire seconds at each tick.\nTimers (and Delays)\nOnce you have a clock that you can watch, you can then define a Timer which is capable of measuring some specific duration of time, according to that clock.\nIf you make that timer pause until the duration of time has passed, you have yourself a Delay.\nBuild the Clock\nAs noted above, the clock can have whatever precision makes sense in your application. \nIf you need millisecond precision, you tick the clock every 1 millisecond.\nIf you need less precision, maybe you tick it every 500 milliseconds, saving yourself some power along the way.\nIf you have the need for multiple different precision clocks (one ticking microseconds while another ticks away seconds), that's also quite possible.\nCreating the clock is as easy as defining a static Clock of the precision you need.\nThe drogue-embedded-timer library has a variety of different clocks set up for a variety of different precisions.\nLet's use a clock with 100ms precision:\nuse drogue_embedded_timer::MillisecondsClock100;\n\nstatic CLOCK: MillisecondsClock100 = MillisecondsClock100::new();\n\nMake the Clock tick.\nOkay, we have a clock, but it's just sitting there, frozen in time.\nThankfully, the clock can provide an external remote-control that will tick it forward (100ms in this case) every time you push the button.\nThe easiest way to push the button on a regular basis is using your HAL's timers and their associated interrupts.\nSo on my board, the first thing I do is use TIM15 and set it up to timeout every 100ms, so that it has a known rhythm that matches my CLOCK defined above:\nlet mut tim15 = Timer::tim15(device.TIM15, 100, clocks, &amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n\nI enable the interrupt so that it fires ever time the timeout occurs, giving me a chance to push the button and advance my CLOCK ahead one 100ms tick:\ntim15.listen(Event::TimeOut);\n\nSince each HAL does things possibly differently, but we know an interrupt must be cleared once it's handled, you're able to provide a callback that will be executed for each tick, to give you a chance to do just that.\nThe callback is actually in the form of an opaque object (usually your TIM* timer object), and a closure that can use that object.\nOn my current board, I'm using the TIM15 timer, and I have to call timer.clear_interrupt(Event::TimeOut) each time the ISR is invoked.\nTherefore, we need to pass that information to the CLOCK when we ask to get the ticker for it:\nlet ticker = CLOCK.ticker(tim15, \n                          (|t| { t.clear_interrupt(Event::TimeOut); }) as fn(&amp;mut Timer&lt;TIM15&gt;));\n\nAll that's left now is to actually wire up the interrupt handler to the TIM15 interrupt.\nUsing RTIC, I bind a task to it. I've also put the ticker into the shared resources so my ISR can access it.\ninit::LateResources {\n    ticker,\n    ...\n}\n\n#[task(binds = TIM15, priority = 15, resources = [ticker])]\nfn ticker(mut ctx: ticker::Context) {\n    ctx.resources.ticker.tick();\n}\n\nI make sure the priority of this ISR is pretty high, because I don't want my clock to slow down if the system is also under load doing other thing.\nAt this point, time is flowing forward.\nTimers &amp; Delays\nNow the CLOCK static is a bonafide embedded-time Clock implementation, and can do all the things Peter's APIs allow you to do.\nYou can create an embedded-time Timer and use it however you like:\n// Create a 10 second timer\nlet timer = embedded_time::Timer::new(&amp;CLOCK, Seconds(10u32));\n\n// Start the timer\nlet timer = timer.start().unwrap();\n\n// Wait for 10 seconds to expire (blocking)\ntimer.wait().unwrap();\n\nOur use-case from the very top of this article, though, is being able to block for a little while.\nThe embedded-hal provide two blocking Delay implementations.\ndrogue-embedded-timer doesn't rely on embedded-hal so we provide an alternative Delay implementation, which is embedded-time-native.\n// Construct a new Delay\nlet mut delay = CLOCK.delay();\n\n// Delay for 4 seconds (blocking)\ndelay.delay(Seconds(4u32));\n\n// Delay for 4000 milliseconds (blocking)\ndelay.delay(Milliseconds(4000u32));\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that your delay will always be at least as long as the precision of your clock.\nSince we created a clock with 100 milliseconds of precision (1/10th of a second), our delay can be no shorter than that.\nMath also tells us our delay could end up being a hair less than twice the precision, depending on how long you're attempting to delay.\nIt's wise to ensure the precision is half the time of your average delay.\nFor instance, if you want to delay for 10 milliseconds, you should probably create a clock with a 5 millisecond precision.\nConclusion\nWith a unified and abstracted way to consider time, timers and delays, device-drivers that need to understand time can be written more generically.\nIt also means less shimming of your board-specific timers into whatever format your driver might want.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/matter-of-time/","title":"It's a Matter of Time"},"https://blog.drogue.io/meet-rodney/":{"body":"Non-technical post -- Hey, we have a new logo!\nFirst, what is a \"drogue\"?\nThe word \"drogue\" has several meanings. \nIt's French for \"drug\" which is probably not the best connotation.\nThe flunkies in A Clockwork Orange were called \"droogs\" which is also not great.\nBut there's also a storm drogue which is used to add stability to vessels in the sea.\n\nWho is Rodney?\nRodney is a garden gnome my niece left in our yard a few years ago. \nHe's adorable and keeps watch over the chickens and the other goings-on in the yard.\n\nHis hat seems rather storm drogue-shaped. \nAnd the new identity\nFor projects, I have started to prefer logos that are actually mascots. \nThey just seem more personable.\nThanks to our handy-dandy designer James Cobb, we\nnow have a logo-fied version of Rodney the gnome:\n\nHe's happy, friendly, and will help add stability to your IoT vessels, we hope.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/meet-rodney/","title":"Meet Rodney"},"https://blog.drogue.io/minikube-roundtrip/":{"body":"Minikube is a convenient tool\nfor developing cloud services on your laptop, but how can you access\nthem from your IoT device?

Maybe not, but it's worth\nexploring. Let's explore.\nEmbedded, RTOS, OSes and Frameworks\nFirst, let's all agree we're doing embedded work on bare chips, where we\ncan pretty freely twiddle any register we want. In the Rust world, this\nwould be called bare metal development.\nTake a step upwards, and you've got a framework such as RTIC, which provides\nfacilities to make writing functional embedded code easier, while also\nmaking it easier to organize your code and reason over it.\nA step beyond that would be something like Zephyr, Tock, Drone or another\nRTOS (real-time operating system). RTOSes can be further differentiated into\n\"hard\" real-time (hey, airbag needs to absolutely fire within 15 nano-seconds\nof impact) or \"soft\" real-time, which relaxes the timing requirements.\nBeyond that, you get to a more general-purpose OS, which may or may not\ninclude things like network drivers and other facilities we've come to\nlove on our machines running BeOS or OS/2 Warp (or, I guess, Linux).\nIn general, all of the above, from an embedded point-of-view, provide basically:\n\nWays to run tasks\nWays to handle interrupts\nMisc useful capabilities used by the above\n\nAn async opportunity\nI have to admit I'm smitten with async and await on Rust. It just works\nthe way my mind does. I also have to admit that I've repeated told my boss\n\"no, dude, we're not writing an RTOS\" (Hi, Mark). Then again, I also must admit that my\nemployer tends to write tools and frameworks for application developers, along\nwith OSes, so I don't think I'm coloring too far outside the lines in exploring\nan async-centric embedded kernel.\nInstead of trying to make Linux (or something that feels Linux-like) fit onto\na small board, what if we built an \"OS\" (but we're not calling it that) from \nthe foundations based upon a modern and safe language (Rust) using modern and\nefficient idioms (async/reactive)?\nBut let's just call it a framework.\nWhat would it look like?\nThis week, it looks like the following:\nWays to run tasks\nWe touched on this in the last blog post I wrote, but it's simply spawning\nasync Rust tasks, probably containing a loop.\nKernel::spawn(\"ld2\", async move {\n    loop {\n        // do awesome stuff\n    }\n});\n\nWays to handle interrupts\nHere we venture somewhat outside of the \"real-time\" aspect of RTOSes, which I think\nis okay, depending on your use-case. Some operating systems attempt to limit the\nwork you actually do within an ISR (interrupt service routine), and rather use an\ninterrupt to wake up a normal \"user-land\" task that is blocked waiting for its\ninterrupt to fire.\nIn my current sketching, I have an API that takes a non async closure, but behind\nthe scenes wraps it in an async task with a wait for my interrupt and a loop.\nThe visible API\nKernel::interrupt(EXTI15_10, move || {\n    if pc13.check_interrupt() {\n        if pc13.is_low().unwrap() {\n            log::info!(\"button pushed\");\n        } else {\n            log::info!(\"button released\");\n        }\n        pc13.clear_interrupt_pending_bit();\n    }\n});\n\nThe internal magic\nIt uses the same Kernel::spawn(...) as non-interrupt tasks, along with my\nasync-capable interrupt(...) API which provides a Future which satisfies\nwhen the associated IRQ is pending.\nThen it just calls the passed in closure.\n    pub fn interrupt&lt;N: Nr + Debug + Copy + 'static, F&gt;(irq: N, mut isr: F) -&gt; Result&lt;(), SpawnError&gt;\n        where F: FnMut() -&gt; () + 'static,\n    {\n        let mut name = String::&lt;U16&gt;::new();\n        write!(name, \"{:?}\", irq);\n        Self::spawn(name.as_str(), async move {\n            loop {\n                interrupt::interrupt(irq).await;\n                isr();\n            }\n        }).map(|_| ())\n    }\n\nUsing the Resources and Organizing Code\nMy example application running on this board uses a single timer to make two LEDs\n\"breathe\" in a non-synchronized manner. You can absolutely re-create this without\nusing async tasks, but you will be managing a shared interrupt across two users\nof that interrupt (the LEDs themselves).\nThis is a very contrived example of using a timer to manually create a poor-man's\nPWM output, but it seemed like a useful challenge to attempt.\nQuick Aside: PWM\nPWM stands for Pulse-Wave Modulation, which in this case means taking a thing that\nis either strictly on or off (the LED), and flipping it on and off fast enough \nto appear that it's at 0 to 100% brightness, on a continuum. The human eye will see\nan LED that is on 50% of the time and off 50% of the time as about half as bright\nas a fully-on LED. If we flip the switch fast enough, it looks \"dim\", and not flickery.\n(Which, coincidently is why slo-mo video under LEDs looks very blinky blinky).\n&lt;/End of Aside&gt;\nSince we're talking about flipping an LED on/off on some sort of regular schedule,\nthat's where the timer is involved. Managing one timer and one LED is \"easy\" for small\nvalues of \"easy\", but using a single timer for multiple LEDs could be more of a challenge\nif you're directly handling the timer's timeout interrupts. So you might be tempted\nto use a timer per LED. Until you run out of timers.\nWith async, we can quite easily manage multiple LEDs from a single timer. With\nmy exploratory kernel, we don't have to think about interrupts, but rather only\ntasks.\nDon't judge my math, but basically we spawn two tasks that look identical (modulo\nan initial delay), which runs a duty_cycle from 1 to 99 and back, repeatedly.\nAt each step, the LED is on for roughly duty_cycle microseconds, and off for 100 - duty_cycle\nmicroseconds. For visual appearances, each time is multiplied by 20 in this case,\nand we linger on each step for 4 iterations of a loop. Then we adjust duty_cycle\nand do it again, turning around when we reach 99 or 1, back and forth, back and forth.\n    Kernel::spawn(\"ld2\", async move {\n        let mut duty_cycle = 1;\n        let mut up = true;\n        let dwell = 4;\n        let mult = 20;\n\n\t// the other task does not have this initial 1sec delay\n        AsyncTimer::delay_ms( Milliseconds(1000u32)).await;\n\n        loop {\n            for _ in 0..dwell {\n                let on: u32 = (duty_cycle * mult) as u32;\n                let off: u32 = ((100 - duty_cycle) * mult) as u32;\n                ld2.set_high().unwrap();\n                AsyncTimer::delay_us(Microseconds(on)).await;\n                ld2.set_low().unwrap();\n                AsyncTimer::delay_us(Microseconds(off)).await;\n            }\n\n            if duty_cycle == 99 {\n                up = false\n            } else if duty_cycle == 1 {\n                up = true;\n            }\n\n            if up {\n                duty_cycle += 1\n            } else {\n                duty_cycle -= 1;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n\n  \n\nAs many tasks as we like can conceivably use the singular AsyncTimer which\nis currently linked to exactly one timer (TIM15 here). Each task\nonly has to focus on the logic of waiting, turning on, waiting, turning off,\nand can ignore the fact that TIM15 interrupts are firing.\nConclusion\nI like where this is going. I think the next steps might be to help isolate\na task's state into an actor framework using async, and providing a\nmessage-passing way for them to safely communicate.\nPlus, I got to try out my new desktop tripod for phone videos. So that's a win.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/more-async-and-pwm/","title":"More Rust & Async (and hand-rolled PWM)"},"https://blog.drogue.io/mpu-6050/":{"body":"While the S in IoT stands for \"security\", the T stands for \"things\", and things move. \nWouldn't it be nice to know how they move, exactly?\nGyroscopes &amp; Gimbals\nA lot of manufactures have started putting gyroscopes into most everything.\nWhen you pair up 3 gyroscopes on each of the 3 real-world axes, you can start to understand how an object pivots around a point.\nWith some advanced processing, these motion processors can keep track of the absolute position (relative to a calibrated start point),\ninstead of just reporting \"turning left for 3 seconds...\"\ni2c\nWhile some of previous experiments worked with USART (serial ports) and SPI (another serial port), our chosen motion processing chip uses the i2c bus, which again is sorta a serial port.\nUnlike SPI, though, where we used a physical signal to select a chip for communications, with i2c, every device on the bus has its own address.\nWithin a transaction, you address bytes to a device, and while the transaction is open, you can read bytes from the device.\nThe content across the i2c bus is pretty device-specific, but there are some commonly-seen conventions.\nRegisters\nA lot of what occurs in the embedded world deals with registers, which are 1-to-4 (or more) bytes of addressable memory.\nMany i2c devices work with the same concept, allowing you to read and write values within registers on the device.\nTo read a an imaginary register (0xAB), which can be addressed by a 1-byte address, and returns a 1-byte value:\n// to hold the response returned\nlet mut response = [0; 1];\n\n// write the address of the register to read, to the device to read from\ni2c.read( device_address, [ 0xAB ], &amp;mut response )\n\nTo write an imaginary register (0xAB), which can be addressed by a 1-byte address, with a 1-byte value (0x42):\ni2c.write( device_address, [ 0xAB, 0x42 ] );\n\nThe device's reference manual should describe the registers and their values.\nAs usual, many registers are bitfields, so you may have to read a register's and toggle specific bits within it before writing it back to the device.\nThe MPU-6050\nThe InvenSense/TDK MPU-6050 is a small motion processor with 3 gyroscopes and matching accelerometers.\nFor this post, we will only be exploring how to make the gyroscopes track movement.\n\nRaw Data\nThe easiest data to retrieve from the MPU-6050 is raw data from the gyroscopes and accelerometers, which is provided in relative terms.\nYou can gain the degrees-per-time or G-forces-per-time for each axis at a given point in time.\nTo consume these values though, you have to do a fair bit of math and bookkeeping on your own.\nDMP Data\nThe MPU-6050 includes a digital motion processor (DMP).\nUltimately, the entire MPU-6050 has its own MCU on-board and runs its own firmware.\nTo take advantage of the DMP, though, you must load, after each power-up, the DMP firmware.\nOur Rust driver helps you out with that.\nThe benefit of using the DMP is that the chip provides for the math and bookkeeping, providing you with a series of quaternions on a FIFO.\nA quaternion involves math significantly beyond my own comprehension, but the bottom line is that they represent an absolute rotation/position of the chip.\nA quaternion is a set of 4 numbers, which uniquely identify how the item is rotated around each of its axes.\nVisualizing\nThe three.js project provides a set of tools for working in three dimensional scenes within the browser.\nEven more importantly, it also works with quaternions.\nIf we can connect the data being pumped from the MPU-6050 to the browser, then the physical motion process can replace two-dimension controls such as a mouse or trackpad.\n\n  \nLet's Rust\nSince this is an i2c device, first we have to set up a typical i2c bus, however is appropriate for your board.\nFor my board, after patching the HAL to support i2c3:\nlet scl3 = gpioc.pc0.into_open_drain_output(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.otyper)\n                    .into_af4(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.afrl);\n\nlet sda3 = gpioc.pc1.into_open_drain_output(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.otyper)\n                    .into_af4(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.afrl);\n\nlet i2c = I2c::i2c3(device.I2C3, (scl3, sda3), KiloHertz(100), clocks, &amp;mut rcc.apb1r1);\n\nNext we create an instance of the MPU-6050 driver attached to that i2c.\nNotice, we're using an embedded-time-based Clock as described in a previous post.\nlet sensor = Mpu6050::new(i2c, Address::default(), &amp;CLOCK).unwrap();\n\nIt can have one of two predetermined i2c addresses, based on if an extra connection is made. \nWe're using the default address.\nWe stuff that into our RTIC shared resources, and pick it up later, in our idle task once the clock is ticking forward.\nUse the Sensor\nSince we want to have to think less about math, we initialize_dmp() to ensure the chip is ready to do our bidding with absolute positioning information:\nlet sensor: &amp;mut Mpu6050&lt;'_, _, _&gt; = ctx.resources.sensor;\nsensor.initialize_dmp().unwrap();\n\nNow, all the important information will be heading towards us through a FIFO, in 28-byte packets.\nYou can drive reading the FIFO from an interrupt if you prefer, but here we're running in a simple loop.\nAs long as there's at least one packet of 28 bytes available, we read it out:\nloop {\n    let len = sensor.get_fifo_count().unwrap();\n    if len &gt;= 28 {\n        let mut buf = [0; 28];\n        let buf = sensor.read_fifo(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();\n         ...\n    }\n}\n\nNow that you have a [u8;28] of bytes, knowing how the packet is constructed is helpful.\nToday, we will use the knowledge that the first 16 bytes are the quaternion in (w, x, y, z) format, 4 bytes for each portion.\nWe can either feed that to the Quaternion::from_bytes(...) to use it on-board, or we can shuffle it straightaway unprocessed to the visualizer.\nWe choose the second option in this case.\n\nTie it all together\nHopefully this post has helped see how we can tie together a bag of disparate drivers, protocols, technologies and languages\ninto a single functioning system.\nThe crate to accomplish all of this from the embedded side is drogue-mpu-6050 and it is available on crates.io.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/mpu-6050/","title":"Motion & MPU-6050"},"https://blog.drogue.io/nom-parser/":{"body":"Routinely we have to deal with recognizing patterns within text or byte streams. \nWhile LL(k) and LALR are common types of parsers, the nom crate brings parser combinators to the embedded Rust world.\nParser Combinators\nAs their name implies, parser combinators are things that can parse inputs, and can be combined to parse even more complex input.\nSimilar to LL(k) type of parsing, small atoms are built up into larger, more capable parsing.\nWhy we parse\nSo far we've implemented two drivers for WiFi-offloading boards. \nBoth of these boards used some variant of Hayes AT commands in order to communicate with your primary device.\nFor instance, when joining a WiFi access point, the eS-WiFi board might reply one of two ways:\nIf successful:\n[JOIN ] myssid,192.168.2.18,0,0\nOK\n&gt; \n\n[JOIN ] myssid\n[JOIN ] Failed\nERROR\n&gt; \n\nFor the device-driver to be able to turn that into an Ok or an Err, we have to pluck apart the bits.\nThe parser\nTo start, we notice that every response concludes with a &gt;  on a new line.\nThat parser is pretty easy to write with nom:\nnamed!(\n    pub prompt,\n    tag!(\"&gt; \")\n);\n\nThis creates a function named prompt() that can take a slice of [u8] and attempt to match a &gt; followed by a space.\nWe notice in the successful case, like so many other commands, we might also need to match OK on a regular basis.\nLet's create a rule for that:\nnamed!(\n    pub ok,\n    tag!(\"OK\\r\\n\")\n);\n\nAdditionally, any error response will include the word ERROR, so let's make a rule there.\nnamed!(\n    pub error,\n    tag!(\"ERROR\\r\\n\")\n);\n\nAlso pretty straight-forward.\nIn the successful case, there's more useful information, such as the assigned IP address that we might want to parse out of the response.\nIgnoring the OK and the &gt;  prompt, we can write a pretty quick parser:\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        tag!(\"[JOIN   ] \") &gt;&gt;\n        ssid: take_until!(\",\") &gt;&gt;\n        char!(',') &gt;&gt;\n        ip: take_until!(\",\") &gt;&gt;\n        char!(',') &gt;&gt;\n        tag!(\"0,0\") &gt;&gt;\n        tag!(\"\\r\\n\") &gt;&gt;\n        ok &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            JoinResponse::Ok\n        )\n    )\n);\n\nNotice we don't have to specifically match many bits. \nWe look for the [JOIN   ]  blob, and then match everything until the first comma as the SSID. \nWe consume that comma, and everything until the next comma is the assigned IP address.\nThen you notice, we are using the ok parser we already created, to match the OK\\r\\n.\nWe've chosen to not match the prompt just yet.\nThe other response, the error case, we can write a very loose parser to match:\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join_error&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        take_until!( \"ERROR\" ) &gt;&gt;\n        error &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            JoinResponse::JoinError\n        )\n    )\n);\n\nBasically, we decide to ignore most everything, and match using our error rule above.\nOf course, that join_error parse rule is pretty ambiguous, but we'll solve that shortly.\nCombining parsers\nWith nom you create your rules, and then you pick one, and attempt to parse a slice of bytes.\nIt either successfully parses, returning a result along with any remainder slice of unparsed bytes,\nor it returns an error, indicating all bytes remain unparsed.\nWhile we're combined the ok and error parsers into the join and join_error parsers,\nwe need some way to glue those two together as another higher-order parser.\nThankfully, nom gives us the alt!(..) macro to do just that. \nAs long as your rules return the same type of result (both are JoinResponse in our case),\nthey can be alt!'d together.\nA first attempt might look like:\nWarning, will not work as you might hope\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join_response&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        tag!(\"\\r\\n\") &gt;&gt;\n        response:\n        alt!(\n              join\n            | join_error\n        ) &gt;&gt;\n        prompt &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            response\n        )\n\n    )\n);\n\nFirst, before we address why it doesn't work, let's deconstruct it a bit.\nEvery response starts with a \\r\\n sequence, which we did not put in either rule, so we match it regardless on our aggregate rule.\nThen we pick with join or join_error and assign it to the response variable.\nThen we finally match the always trailing prompt and return the matches response.\nWhy doesn't this work?\nBecause nom allows for streaming parsing, knowing that maybe it didn't completely parse something this time, but once you add a few more bytes, maybe it'll match next time.\nGiven the definition of join, we match a given prefix up to a comma.\nIn the error case, the comma is not present. \nYou might think that'd force it to attempt the second option of join_error which requires no comma, but nom is an optimist. \nParsing of join did not fail, it just hadn't yet succeeded.\nGiven the way we use the parser, though, we know in our case there are no additional bytes to be expected.\nWhat you've got is all there is, so let's let nom know that by wrapping the rules with complete!(...).\nThis signals that a rule that has not yet succeeded should be considered a failure, and for nom to continue evaluating other alternatives.\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join_response&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        tag!(\"\\r\\n\") &gt;&gt;\n        response:\n        alt!(\n              complete!(join)\n            | complete!(join_error)\n        ) &gt;&gt;\n        prompt &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            response\n        )\n\n    )\n);\n\nNow, all we have to do is use the parser, and we'll get back the result we're hoping for:\nlet parse_result = parser::join_response(&amp;bytes);\n\nmatch parse_result {\n    Ok((_remainder, response)) =&gt; {\n        match response {\n            JoinResponse::Ok =&gt; {\n                // yay!\n            }\n            JoinResponse::JoinError =&gt; {\n                // bad password or ssid or such\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    Err(_) =&gt; {\n        // something went woefully wrong during parsing\n    }\n}\n\nIn this case, we know the slice we parsed was complete, so we can ignore the _remainder since it should, in theory, be empty.\nMore complex\nWe've also published an uber-tiny drogue-nom-utils crate to provide helper and utility parsers that we have used more than once.\nSome of these adapters will transmit a response like the following to indicate a certain amount of data is available for a certain connection:\n+IPD,&lt;link_id&gt;,&lt;length&gt;\n\nThe length portion is simply the characters that make up the length, such as 1024; a 1 followed by a 0 followed by a 2 and a 4. \nSo we need to parse that as an actual numeric type, not an array of 4 number-looking ASCII characters.\nThe conversion of ASCII to numbers is usually easy, unless you're no_std so we have our own atoi_usize to do that for usize-sized numbers.\nTo make a parser combinator that can parse a sequence of ASCII digits and return a single usize, we write a function in the style of nom:\npub fn parse_usize(input: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;[u8], usize&gt; {\n    let (input, digits) = digit1(input)?;\n    let num = atoi_usize(digits).unwrap();\n    IResult::Ok((input, num))\n}\n\nWhich can then be used like:\nnamed!(\n    pub data_available&lt;Response&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        opt!( crlf ) &gt;&gt;\n        tag!( \"+IPD,\") &gt;&gt;\n        link_id: parse_usize &gt;&gt;\n        char!(',') &gt;&gt;\n        len: parse_usize &gt;&gt;\n        crlf &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            Response::DataAvailable {link_id, len }\n        )\n    )\n);\n\nOne nice thing about nom is that you can feed data forward within a do_parse!, using the result of parse_usize in another macro such as take!(len).\nCombinators in the tin\nWhile we write our own domain-specific combinators, nom ships with a vast array of useful ones beyond the tag!, alt! and complete! that we've seen. \nEach of these macros can also be replaced with function calls if you have some fancy logic you want to involve in your parsing.\nA short (and incomplete) list of the combinators we've found useful:\n\nalt!: Try a list of parsers and return the result of the first successful one\nchar!: matches one character: `char!(char) =&gt; &amp;u8 -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;u8, char&gt;\ncomplete!: replaces a Incomplete returned by the child parser with an Error\ndo_parse!: \tapplies sub parsers in a sequence. it can store intermediary results and make them available for later parsers\nopt!: make the underlying parser optional\ntag!: declares a byte array as a suite to recognize\ntake!: generates a parser consuming the specified number of bytes\n\nSupports no_std\nNom works fantastically well, even in a no_std environment. \nYou can't use the regexp combinators without std, but even if you did use regexps, then you'd have two problems.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/nom-parser/","title":"Nom Parser"},"https://blog.drogue.io/pcb-part-1/":{"body":"For some time now, we've wanted to have a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that we could use to demonstrate Drogue Device and Drogue Cloud. This is the first post in a series of post telling the tale of this journey.\nMotivation\nA few months back, an opportunity for designing our own PCB presented it self: there was a need to produce some custom devices for demos and workshops. Without going further into specifics, the devices will send and receive data to/from the cloud that runs Red Hat services on the Red Hat cloud. Since this is a good match for the Drogue IoT project, we started to gather some requirements. The initial list was:\n\nMust run on battery\nReport sensor data at regular intervals\nReceive commands over radio\nSensors such as temperature and light sensors\nButtons and some way to indicate status\nWireless\n\nThe experience of designing PCBs in the group was almost non-existing, and even then there is the challenge of logistics: a potential large amount of devices when there is a global chip shortage going on needs some careful planning.\nCommunication\nFor communicating with the outside world, we needed to look into RF protocols.\nWe started exploring the possibility of using plain Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for the device communication since we've already used that a few times. However, with a large number of devices, spread over big area, broadcasting to all devices using plain peer-to-peer BLE connections might not work well with gateways. In addition, this would require all devices to be within the range of a gateway. Luckily, the BLE Mesh standard solves a lot of these problems, and should work with up to 32768 devices, so it should be good enough for our use case.\nAn alternative to using BLE Mesh would be to use ZigBee/Thread, but due to the great driver support for BLE, especially on the nRF52 which we've used before, it seemed like the safest choice. You can read more about our BLE Mesh stack in this post.\nLikewise, LoRaWAN is not that great for this use case due to the bandwidth limits, and the additional latency added by the larger RF time slots.\nSelecting the microcontroller\nWith a global chip shortage, selecting the microcontroller to use was a challenge. Since we decided to use BLE, using nRF52 was a natural choice given the great support in Embassy. However, finding nRF52 available in larger volumes was harder than we thought due to chip shortage.\nWith the risk of not having the hardware available to us in time, we need to look into other options. Unfortunately, most STM32 chips that would fit our use case are also out of stock, which meant that we would need to spend more time on supporting new hardware.\nHost + Expansion board\nIn addition, getting the microcontroller hardware and peripherals correct for our first PCB was also a risk that we needed to deal with. Anticipating a few round trips of PCB re-design, we could risk not having hardware for writing our firmware until the last minute.\nTo deal with this risk, and solving the chip shortage problem at the same time, we decided to write an expansion board for a in-stock \"host\" board with the chip we wanted to use. We could order samples of the target board and start writing the firmware, while designing the PCB with the peripherals that we wanted to use in parallel.\nWe considered using the BBC micro:bit as the host board, but it turned out this was also out of stock. Luckily, Adafruit Industries had a lot of Adafruit nRF52 Feather boards available.\nThis meant that we would be able to target the nRF52840 chip, which has 256kB of RAM and 1024kB of flash, which should be sufficient for our use case.\nThe Feather boards with nRF52840 are available in two variants:\n\nFeather Express\nFeather Sense\n\nThe Feather Sense has a lot of sensors on board, which is great in that our PCB could be simpler. On the other hand, some sensors on board for temperature and light sensing are not easily identifiable, which we need for the types of applications that we will be running. Another disadvantage of the Feather Sense is the lack of a connector for debug probes.\nThe Feather Express has the SWD connector for debug probes, but does not have any additional sensors.\nWe decided to add the required sensors to our PCB and aim to use the Feather Express, but keep the Feather Sense as an option until we saw how well the PCB prototyping went. This way, we only needed to get the simpler circuit bits like LEDs and buttons correct.\nInitial design\nWith the host board somewhat decided, we could start on designing the PCB for the expansion board, with the code name burrboard.\nThe initial sketch looked something like this:\n\nThe light and temperature sensors would be clearly visible to allow manipulation by the user. The buttons are modelled after the micro:bit buttons to provide some way to interact.\nFor powering the device, we had several options:\n\nLiPo batteries\nCoin cell batteries\nAA/AAA batteries\n\nThe LiPoly batteries are natively supported by the feathers. However, they are a bit expensive and also we had some concern about the safety given that we were handing these out to a lot of people.\nUsing coin cell batteries was an attractive alternative that we initially wanted to use. However, these batteries do not handle current spikes well, and at the time we had no idea of how much power our application would use, given that we'd be transmitting and receiving data very frequently.\nTherefore, going with 3xAAA batteries seemed like the safest and less risky route.\nOnly one question remained: how to power the feather using a custom battery? The LiPo connector is external to the feather, and it should not be used by any other battery type. After studying the pinout diagram and power documentation of the feather, one alternative stood out: powering the feather using the VUSB pin. Some testing on a breadboard hooked up to a Feather board confirmed that this approach would work. The only risk would be that\nshould the battery ciruitry be connected while USB is connected, we would risk to destroy a USB port that doesn't have reverse current protection. To protect against this, we added a power switch. To protect against the power switch layout being wrong, we added a jumper header for good measure.\nLearning KiCad\nWhich PCB design tool to use? Well, we like to do everything in the open and make it open source, so KiCad felt like the natural choice.\nThere are many guides and videos on using KiCad on YouTube, which was helpful in learning the basics of designing a PCB and what to look out for. I found the videos from Digi Key useful to learn KiCad.\nThe first step in creating the PCB was to draw the schematic. The initial revision looked like this:\n\nIt contains the following sensors with the required resistors and capacitors from their datasheet:\n\n\nTMP36 from Analog Devices. This temperature sensor had plenty in stock, and seemed simple to wire, and can be read using the ADC on the nRF chip. It was available in both through-hole (THT) and surface mount (SMD) editions, which made it possible to prototype with it on a breadboard as well.\n\n\nADXL345 also from Analog Devices. This accelerometer was the only one that was in stock, had a breakout board available from SparkFun, and also had an existing rust driver available.\n\n\nTEMT6000X01 from Vishay Semiconductors. This analog phototransistor was in stock, and also had breakout boards available for testing. As with the temperature sensor, we can read the data using the ADC.\n\n\nWhile drawing the schematic, we ordered breakout boards or THT components of the sensors so that we could quickly test the firmware without waiting for the PCB to be finished.\nThe rest of the schematic contains\n\nTwo tactile push buttons for interacting with the device.\nA battery holder using 3xAAA batteries.\nA power switch\nA jumper header to ensure we don't accidentally connect battery in case of errors\nHeaders matching the Adafruit Feather form factor\n\nAll the components are wired together in the schematic. You can find the KiCad project for Revision 1 here. Note that the current revision as of this writing is 3.5, located in the main branch.\nBill of Materials (BOM)\nPerhaps the most challenging part of PCB design is locating the correct parts, primarily because there are so many variants of footprints to choose from. Some trial and error is expected when doing this for the first time, but most of the information needed is available in the datasheets.\nFor all the symbols in the schematic, we added manufcaturer part numbers as well as supplier-specific numbers where available. KiCad uses this information to generate a BOM with all the parts, and both suppliers and PCB assemblies can make use of this to quickly order parts or look if they have parts in stock.\nPCB layout\nOnce the PCB schematic and BOM is complete, its time to do some PCB layout. Once again, there are a lot of videos on how to do this in KiCad, so we won't cover that here. The initial version of the PCB looked like this:\n\nAs you can see, we managed to add a nice photo of Rodney on the board. Once the layout is complete, it's important to generate and check the gerber files. The gerber files are a set of files that each describe the layers of the PCB. In our case, we have a PCB with two physical layers, front and back. In addition, there are the solder mask layers, which describe the pads for SMD and THT components. The last part is the silk screen layer, where all drawings are put. The most important functionality of this layer is the ability to print the reference designators for the different components, along with orientation hints (you don't want to solder your LED the wrong way).\nOrdering the PCB\nHaving both completed the initial revision, and validated the circuit using THT components and breakout boards, it was time to order some prototypes of the PCB.\nThere are many PCB suppliers, but in our case we needed someone who could manufacture and send the prototypes quickly. For the first revision of the board, we went with Aisler. Their PCB service accepts KiCad project files instead of gerber files, and also allows ordering parts for the assembly if you need (but at a higher cost).\nUnfortunately, the boards from Aisler took a lot longer than expected to arrive, and we actually ended up finishing revision 2 after some more thought and feedback. Lesson: if you're not in a hurry, make sure you take some time to ensure all requirements are captured before ordering.\nWe received the first PCB based on revision 2.0 of the design. The PCB contains many SMD components, which can be a challenge to hand-solder. Luckily, yours truly owns a mini hot plate! As this was the first time soldering SMD components with this, I was amazed at how easy and quick this was compared to hand-soldering through-hole components. The biggest challenge is that you need a steady hand and good eyesight! \n\nAs you can see from dark patches here and there, some experimentation was needed before figuring out the technique. The ADXL345 accelerometer was by far the hardest component to solder, as it has very little spacing between the pads, so adding too much solder paste would cause it to misalign. \nSummary\nWe've seen the evolution of our PCB from initial requirements, and the different design choices we've made throughout the process.\nIn the next post, we'll go on to describe the new requirements, have a look at the next revision of the design, and look at how testing of the prototype went along with the lessons we've learned.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/pcb-part-1/","title":"The making of a PCB: Part 1"},"https://blog.drogue.io/pcb-part-2/":{"body":"Producing 1 PCB is very different from producing many PCBs, especially considering the logistics of assembling and testing. In this blog post, we'll continue the story from last time and look at the revised versions and how to scale up the production with PCB assembly and a test jig.\nTesting and review\nThe initial revision of the PCB worked for the most part. All the critical sensors appeared to be working, but we found a few things to improve on the design, and a design review with James Munns helped identifying some additional improvements.\n\n    \n    Revision 2.0\n\nButton placement\nThe button placement was too close to the thumb when operating with one hand. The fix for this was to place them closer to the center.\nLED brightness\nThe LEDs functioned correctly, but the brightness was not completely even. In particular, the red and green LEDs were a lot brighter than the others. After doubling the resistance, the brightness of the LEDs were a lot more balanced.\nBattery measurement\nThe battery measurement circuit was wrong, and caused inputs outside the ADC range of the microcontroller. Fixing this involved using different resistor values for the circuit.\nAccelerometer orientation\nIn order to make the sensor output compatible with both the Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense and Feather Adafruit nRF52840 Express, we switched the orientation of the accelerometer to make sure the output axes values was the same.\nBoard outline\nThe sharp edges are a bit annoying when using the device. Given that this device is supposed to be used in a game like setting, we added some rounded corners.\nIn addition,we added a few holes so that we could add a string and users would be able to wear the device around their neck.\nTo avoid any potential for radio interference of the Adafruit from the PCB, we also added a keep out zone beneath the radio for good measure.\nPower\nIn the initial revision, the power switch was connected to the EN pin of the Adafruit, as this would allow us to use the switch for LiPoly batteries as well. However, even in this mode the device draws power, so we decided to have the switch control the battery power source directly and remove the jumper pins we placed there to prevent accidental reverse current. Instead, we added a Schottky diode to prevent the case of reverse current with both batteries and USB power connected.\nPairing with BLE Mesh\nSince the devices are going to be part of a BLE Mesh network and paired with a single application, we need a way to provision them and identify them. In order to do that, we decided to make room for a QR code sticker in the middle of the board. Then, upon flashing the device, we would set the expected mesh node UUID in the device firmware, and create a mapping between the UUID and a QR code. \nThe pairing process will then use this data to ensure sensor data is routed to the expected application.\nWiring and traces\nIn the initial revision, the outline made no use of ground vias, a technique that adds vias to the board in order to reduce the path from components to ground.\nNew revision\n\n    \n    Revision 3.0\n\nHaving fixed the defects, we also initially removed the accelerometer footprint from the PCB, and revision 3.0 did not include it\nRevision 3.0 felt much better in hand, and all sensors worked as we hoped. The biggest unknown before testing was the Schottky diode (which is a component we had not tested before)\nas you can see below. However, to avoid risking supply chain issues, we quickly decided to add it back for a final revision 3.5, with the option of not soldering it when scaling up production.\n\nFlash jig\n\n    \n    Test jig\n\nProgramming the Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express/Sense without the builtin bootloader requires powering the device from USB and attaching an external programmer using one of the following alternatives:\n\nAttaching a SWD cable (only available on the Express)\nSolder wires to SWD solder pads on the back side of the feather\n\nBoth alternatives work for a few devices, but with the potential of 500 devices being made, we needed a better and more efficient way to program them. After reading about test jigs, we decided to build a custom test jig for the feather, with the goal of not needing any connectors to be attached in order to program the feather.\nIn order to do that, we did research on the use of spring loaded pins, aka pogo pins. After initial experimentation to understand how these pins behaved, we ended up with a setup that worked quite well, and would allow us to spend most time only waiting for the flash operation to succeed.\nIn order to build the jig, we needed another custom PCB which had the appropriate footprints for the pogo pins, as well as a way to power the feather using the VUSB and GND pins. After some trial and error, we found some pins that worked out nicely with the feather pins. The board draws power from USB, which will also power the feather when pressed down on the jig. The debug probe is connected to the 4 pins (VTarget, SWDIO, SWDCLK, GND). When the feather touches the standoffs, it will touch all 4 pogo pins as well, at which point one can program the device with the debug probe.\nWe also published a video of how to operate the test jig with one hand.\n\nPCB assembly\nFor someone not familiar with PCB manufacturing, getting to the point where we could order fully assembled devices was a challenge. Most manufacturers have some online quotation service, but ultimately it was easier talking to their sales department and get the necessary help. We decided to order 5 fully assembled PCBs from RushPCB, who were very helpful and guiding us to retrieve the information they needed.\nFor the assembly, we had to prepare (in addition to the gerbers for PCB production itself):\n\nA Bill of Materials (BOM) for all the components, including the manufacturing part number and the reference designator on the board where it should be placed.\nA component placement file, which can be prepared by KiCad. \nAssembly drawings and instructions. This is essentially a document containing the silk screen, fabrication outline and drill layers, with comments if you have any special requirements. The important part here is that you should assume this document to be read by a human being if clarifications are needed.\n\nBefore scaling up production, we decided to order 5 initial pre-assembled boards from RushPCB to ensure we got things right.\n\n    \n    Revision 3.5 (soldered, with accelerometer)\n\nThe final revision worked as we hoped, with some tweaks to ensure the firmware were using the correct ports. After spending some time with the accelerometer, we also made some improvements for the driver to work reliably.\nSummary\nThroughout these two blog posts, we've seen the steps we took starting from the initial drawing to a potential large scale manufacturing of a fully assembled PCB, including additional equipment to program the devices. A lot of trial and error is expected when trying something new, but we got something that worked in the end. With KiCad, there is a lot of open hardware \nAll the design for the PCB can be found on github. You can also find the firmware that runs the BLE Mesh and BLE GATT services, and early stages of a GATT client/gateway and BLE Mesh gateway, which we'll write more about in the future.\nEventually, the large scale manufacturing of this device did not happen, but we certainly learned a lot in the process, which we plan to make use of as we want to create more boards to demonstrate Drogue IoT, both cloud and device. \n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/pcb-part-2/","title":"The making of a PCB: Part 2"},"https://blog.drogue.io/quarkus-func-payload-mapper/":{"body":"In the previous post we introduced Func project as a very useful framework for writing serverless functions in the Knative world. The post ended with the question what can we do with it? So let's explore one practical use case now.\n\nEarlier, we showed how we can use Eclipse Ditto digital twin platform in combination with Drogue cloud and implemented a service that uses Eclipse Vorto device models to map device telemetry payload to appropriate Ditto commands.\nOne of the things we continued investigating was how we can use digital twins even without Vorto models for simple use cases. And it all boils down to basic use case of payload mapping.\nFor example, our device sends telemetry in the simple JSON format like:\n{\n    \"temp\": 23.0,\n    \"hum\": 51.0\n}\n\nand we need to convert it to a Ditto command that will actually modify the state of the digital twin:\n{\n    \"path\": \"/features\",\n    \"topic\": \"app_id/simple-thing/things/twin/commands/modify\",\n    \"value\": {\n        \"hum\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"value\": \"51.0\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"temp\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"value\": 23.0\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis use case is quite common if we want to look at the Drogue cloud as an IoT integration platform. Eclipse Ditto is just one of the services where our telemetry data will end up, but you can imagine various others like time series databases, data lakes, etc. all with their own payload formats.\nIf you take a look at these kind of services we can see that they are simple, stateless services with well defined input and output. And we have to be able to scale them up and down depending on the data volume. That sounds like a perfect serverless use case.\nAll this led to the idea of using Func with Quarkus runtime to implement one such service and see what's the developer experience in doing so. So, let's see.\nCloud native Ditto\nBefore we dive into implementing the converter service, let's quickly recap Ditto and how it fits into our stack. Ditto provides an HTTP API which can be used to manage your things. In order to start, you need to first create your \"thing\" using the HTTP API:\necho \"{}\" | http --auth ditto:ditto PUT http://$TWIN_API/api/2/things/app_id:simple-thing\n\nBeyond HTTP API, Ditto provides a Cloud Events API, which allow us to issue commands (from the example above) as well formed cloud events, like:\ncat modify.json |  http -v --auth ditto:ditto http://$TWIN_API/api/2/cloudevents \\\n  Content-Type:application/json \\\n  Ce-Id:9bc19ad9-1c37-4041-b488-5b622e63bbfa \\\n  Ce-Source:drogue://app%5Fid/simple%2Dthing \\\n  Ce-Subject:foo \\\n  Ce-Type:io.drogue.event.v1 \\\n  Ce-Specversion:1.0 \\\n  Ce-Application:app \\\n  Ce-Device:device\n\nAnd we can make sure that our changes took place:\nhttp --auth ditto:ditto http://$TWIN_API/api/2/things/app_id:simple-thing\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\netag: \"rev:2\"\nresponse-required: false\nversion: 2\n\n{\n    \"features\": {\n        \"hum\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"value\": \"52.0\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"temp\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"value\": 22.5\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"policyId\": \"app_id:simple-thing\",\n    \"thingId\": \"app_id:simple-thing\"\n}\n\nWhy is this important? Well, it allow us to integrate it into the Knative workflows. Take a look at the following example:\napiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1\nkind: KafkaSource\nmetadata:\n  name: ditto-converter-kafka-source\n  labels:\n    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: digital-twin\nspec:\n  consumerGroup: ditto-converter\n  bootstrapServers:\n    - kafka-eventing-kafka-bootstrap.knative-eventing.svc:9092\n  topics:\n    - knative-messaging-kafka.drogue-iot.iot-channel\n  sink:\n    ref:\n      apiVersion: flows.knative.dev/v1\n      kind: Sequence\n      name: ditto-converter\n---\napiVersion: flows.knative.dev/v1\nkind: Sequence\nmetadata:\n  name: ditto-converter\n  labels:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: digital-twin\n    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: digital-twin\nspec:\n  channelTemplate:\n    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1alpha1\n    kind: KafkaChannel\n    spec:\n      numPartitions: 1\n      replicationFactor: 1\n  steps:\n    - ref:\n        apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n        kind: Service\n        name: drogue-ditto-converter\n  reply:\n    uri: http://ditto:ditto@ditto-nginx.drogue-iot.svc.cluster.local:8080/api/2/cloudevents\n\nHere, we defined a KafkaSource with telemetry messages coming from our devices and wired it to the Knative Sequence. The sequence in this case will call our converter service and then post a result to Ditto's Cloud event API (with properly converted payload).\nOK, now it all makes more sense and we can start discussing how we are going to implement the converter service.\nFunc\nWe already have a couple Knative services in Drogue cloud implemented with Rust and Quarkus, but they are hand-crafted from the ground up. Now, let's see how Func can help developing these kind of services.\nDeveloping\nYou can create a new project with:\nfunc create --runtime quarkus --trigger events\n\nThis will create a Quarkus serverless project triggered by Cloud events instead of regular HTTP requests. Just what we need.\nYou can find a full implementation of our service at https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-ditto-converter, but let's focus here on some important snippets. The project will use Quarkus Funqy support to provide a stub of our service. Now we can implement it like:\n    @Funq\n    public CloudEvent&lt;DittoCommand&gt; convert(CloudEvent&lt;DrogueDevice&gt; input) throws Exception {\n\n        DrogueDevice device = input.data();\n        ...\n        DittoCommand command = DittoCommand.from(device);\n\n        CloudEvent&lt;DittoCommand&gt; event = CloudEventBuilder.create(input)\n                .build(command);\n\n        return event;\n    }\n\nHere, we provided POJOs for our input and output data formats and everything else (JSON marshalling) will be taken care of. The only thing left to do is to create cloud event and return it.\nThe nice thing about all this is that we can develop our function in a typical Quarkus fashion without any need for cloud resource.

In Quarkus terms you can build a JVM or native image\nfunc build -v                  # build jar\nfunc build --builder native -v # build native binary\n\nAnd the deploy it to your cluster (By default deploy will build image as well).\nfunc deploy -v\n\nThis will deploy our function as Knative service, but for full functionality we'll also need our source and sequence deployed:\nkubectl apply -n drogue-iot -f src/main/k8s/ditto-converter.yaml\n\nNow we should have everything set, so let's test it out.\nTesting\nLet's create a matching app and device in Drogue cloud (in the future we can sync creation of resource in Drogue and Ditto using registry change events).\ndrg create app app_id\ndrg create device --app app_id simple-thing --data '{\"credentials\": {\"credentials\":[{ \"pass\": \"foobar\" }]}}'\n\nAnd we're ready to send some data\nhttp --auth simple-thing@app_id:foobar --verify build/certs/endpoints/ca-bundle.pem POST https://$HTTP_ENDPOINT/v1/foo data_schema==ditto:test temp:=21.5 hum=51.0\n\nNow we can check the state of our twin and make sure our changes are persisted\nhttp --auth ditto:ditto http://$TWIN_API/api/2/things/app_id:simple-thing\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\netag: \"rev:2\"\nresponse-required: false\nversion: 2\n\n{\n    \"features\": {\n        \"hum\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"value\": \"51.0\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"temp\": {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"value\": 21.5\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"policyId\": \"app_id:simple-thing\",\n    \"thingId\": \"app_id:simple-thing\"\n}\n\nSo we can see that our sensor data went via HTTP endpoint to Knative Kafka channel and then through our payload converter function reached the digital twin platform.\nFuture\nWe hope this post make you realize how Func in combination with Quarkus make a good platform for creating serverless function that have real applications in IoT cloud platforms. We'll strive to make the experience even better in the future. Here are some notes on the experience and future improvements.\nFirst on the Func side, the current function developer workflow is generally good. What would make it even better is making it more tied with the accompanied resources (sources and sequences in our case). We can do two things in that area. We can make func CLI manage (deploy/delete) custom yaml resources along with the service itself. But also, it'd be good if func would just be able to generate service yaml resource so we can add it to existing workflows (GitOps for example).\nOn the Quarkus side there are a few small improvements that could be made. Even if the docs says, it requires Java 11, it actually sets Java 8 as default version. Also, the Funq implements its own Cloud Events abstractions, which are not as polished as official SDK. And using the official ones would be a better choice to stay current with the spec implementation in the long run. These are all small niggles that we're gonna feed back into the upstream community and try to improve upon.\nAnd of course, the Rust support for Func is on the way (still in early development). You can take a look at the following PRs (boson-project/buildpacks#95 and boson-project/func#376) if you'd like to get more information or contribute to the effort. We want to make Rust first-class citizen for developing serverless functions and provide a great experience. And as we want to use them in Drogue cloud we want to help out with the effort. So stay tuned.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/quarkus-func-payload-mapper/","title":"Implement payload mapper with Func and Quarkus"},"https://blog.drogue.io/release-030/":{"body":"So far, we didn't really release anything. We created tagged versions, so that you don't need to rely on latest,\nwhich might change any second. We had a release pipeline in the CI. Still, it just didn't feel ready enough.\nThis time it is different.\nNew and noteworthy\nThe new release mostly added some missing features and improved on the existing ones. It still isn't complete, but\na big step forward.\nCommand and control\nThis release introduced the concept of command &amp; control (aka cloud-to-device messaging). There is a dedicated\ndrop-off endpoint for commands, and both the HTTP and MQTT endpoint have been enhanced to take care of this\nfunctionality. Using HTTP you can wait for a short time to receive a command when you deliver some payload to the cloud.\nFor MQTT, you can subscribe and wait for commands to come along.\nThis is just the first iteration on this. There are a bunch of things left to solve. However, currently there is\nRFC 2 open, working on refining the APIs and the behavior of this\nfunctionality. You are welcome to join.\nBetter getting started experience\nWhen you installed Drogue cloud, you already got some information and example commands in the end to try it out.\nHowever, when you didn't install it yourself, then you didn't get this information. So we added the same information\non the web console:\n\nYou put in the information on the right side, and the out the commands for executing on the command line. Even if you\nnever installed Drogue cloud yourself.\nAlso did we integrate all services with the installed Keycloak instance. Read on, if you want to know why this is so important.\nDevice registry improvements\nA lot of work went into a refined device registry. The highlights are:\n\nScoping of devices by application (aka tenants, aka namespaces, aka …)\nPassword and Username/password authentication\nX.509 client certificates authentication for devices\nAdded the concept of gateway devices\n\nTechnically we switched from a Diesel based backend to\ntokio-postgres, which allows us to use async all the way. However, this\nis something that you shouldn't even notice.\nThe much improved API however is something that should notice. Creating applications and devices is now possible, as is\nupdating and deleting them: CRUD! There is a lot of work planned in this area, so the APIs will definitely be changed\nagain.\nYes, applications is a concept we introduced in this release as well. Some other systems may call this \"project\",\n\"namespace\", \"tenant\", or \"scope\". It is a container, which owns devices. You can create a new \"application\", and then\nadd \"devices\" to it. Deleting an application will also delete all the devices.\nAuthenticating devices has also improved a lot. You can use a simple combination of \"device\" and \"password\", or use\nan explicit username/password combination. Or you can go crazy and create your own trust anchor, issuing X.509\nclient certificates.\nThe sandbox\nSetting up Drogue Cloud can be done on your local machine, using Minikube, CRC, or Kind. Of course, you can also deploy\nthis on a real cluster. However, that may take much more effort.\nOn the other side, we need to have a publicly available instance for our development as well. Playing with services like\nThe Thing Network requires public access to our services. So, why not host our own instance.\nAs we already used Keycloak for single sign-on, it was pretty easy to integrate this\nwith GitHub, and let everyone create an account. In a nutshell, we have a publicly available sandbox, for everyone to\nplay with.\n\nNote: Read the text on the login page carefully! This is an open sandbox, none of the data you send to this instance\nis safe! It may also go down any second!\nAs you can see, the warning message is bigger than the login dialog. Getting started is easy, as you only need to log in\nwith your GitHub account.\nWe are aware of the fact that some functionalities, also security related, are still missing. That is why we plan to\nupgrade the instance with every release of Drogue Cloud from now on. However, if you just want to play with the\nembedded Rust stuff, you may now have something to send your data towards, without the need to deploy something yourself.\nNext steps\nThere is already lot of stuff going on:\n\n\nDefining CloudEvents mappings – RFC 3\nCurrently, the way we fill the CloudEvents attributes is a bit inconsistent. We plan to improve on this, and you are\nwelcome to join the effort.\n\n\nService authentication/authorization\nYes, this is missing, we need it. Embarrassing, but it will come. \n\n\nIntegration device registry\nThis is a major topic, and will cause some changes in the device management APIs. In addition to configuring our own\nsystem, we also want to use our device registry to configure other services, so that we can easily integrate with\nthem. For that we need events when applications and devices change, and a reasonable way to reconcile.\n\n\nA CoAP endpoint\nCoAP is definitely something that we want. And maybe, we can have it sooner rather than later. Adding CoAP on the\ncloud side is a proposed project for Google Summer of Code, and there seems to be already interest in that project.\n\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/release-030/","title":"Drogue Cloud: Release 0.3.0"},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-async/":{"body":"async/await within Rust is a convenient way to gain parallelism,\neven on an embedded device where we ostensibly have exactly one userland\nthread by default.\nThreads and async/await\nFirst, threads...\nWhile living the larger laptop/server CPU lifestyle, we've grown acustomed\nto having threads. Lots of threads. Each thread generally provides the illusion\nof a straight-line execution of code that owns the entire processor. \nAs some books describe it, from the thread's point-of-view, the whole processor\nis theirs, just sometimes (while other threads are running), it's just a very\nslow processor.\nTo accomplish this magic of appearing to own the entire processor, threads\nalso have to actually give each thread its own space for its stack \nto grow. Additionally, the kernel has to occasionally freeze one thread, swap\nout that thread's stack for another waiting thread's, and then unfreeze the other \nthread to run for a bit. This is context switching.\nThe same thing happens when running multiple processes instead of just threads,\nbut then the heap and the memory-manager gets involved, so that each process has\nits own supposedly unlimited memory address space.\nThis is all great (aside from race conditions), but also quite heavy for achieving\nparallelism on a small $2 MCU that is already running its tail off to blink some LEDs\nin a timely manner.\nNow, async...\nWith Rust (and several other languages), there's the idea of async and await,\nwhich ultimately represent a way to deal with cooperative multi-tasking, instead\nof preemptive as defined by modern threads and processes.\nTo live the async lifestyle with Rust, you first must mark your function or method as\nasync. Unfortunately, you can now no longer call this method from code that isn't \nalso async. And simply marking your function as async really accomplishes very little.\nBut once you're in an async context (getting into one, we'll address shortly), you can \ncall other async functions, and here's where the magic happens. Calling an async function \nwill not return the result you're asking for. Great? Great! Instead, it signals you'd like \nthat function to go off, and do whatever it needs to do, and you'll check back later when \nyou need to know the answer.\nasync fn foo() {\n  let not_the_result = bar();\n  // bar is possibly chugging away doing work, maybe, kinda\n\n  ... lots of other stuff ...\n\n  // NOW we care if bar() has completed, and will do nothing\n  // else until it does.\n  let actually_the_result = not_the_result.await;\n}\n\nUltimately, an async function returns a future that will, from your caller's\npoint-of-view, block when you .await until it's satisfied. \nThe awesomeness: it's not really blocking, in terms of blocking the single MCU\nprocessor from doing other stuff. Which is where the real power lies.\nIs it async turtles all the way down?\nAs noted above, you can only call an async function from within an already async context.\nHow do you get into an async context to start? \nExecutors\nAn executor is a bit of code that can take an async block as an argument, and spawn it\ninto an async context where the magic can then happen. The Rust ecosystem has a few executors,\nand the embedded Rust ecosystem has a few also. The executor API is pretty much left to the\nimplementation, so read the docs of whichever you choose.\nWhy is this good for embedded?\nWe generally have a single core, underpowered little processor without a memory-management\nunit. We also prefer to statically allocate as much as we can, without over-allocating\nmemory \"just in case\" because sometimes we're only rocking 48kb to play with. While\nyou can certainly implement preemptive threading on an MCU, you would then have to estimate\nand reserve stack space per thread, possibly over/under-allocating.\nWith some strategies, you can precisely allocate memory with async tasks and deterministically\nknow you won't inadvertantly OOM. If you spawn new tasks willy-nilly, then of course you can\nstill exhaust your executor's memory pool, but that can be controllable and isolated to\njust the executor, not corrupting your entire memory space.\nLet's see an example\nI have some proof-of-concept code deep within a secure arctic bunker that I hope to clean up \nand publish shortly, but here's an example of... what else... blinky, using async and await.\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    rtt_init_print!();\n    log::set_logger(&amp;LOGGER).unwrap();\n    log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Debug);\n\n    let mut device = Peripherals::take().unwrap();\n\n    log::info!(\"initializing\");\n    let mut flash = device.FLASH.constrain();\n    let mut rcc = device.RCC.constrain();\n    let mut pwr = device.PWR.constrain(&amp;mut rcc.apb1r1);\n    let clocks = rcc\n        .cfgr\n        .sysclk(80.mhz())\n        .pclk1(80.mhz())\n        .pclk2(80.mhz())\n        .freeze(&amp;mut flash.acr, &amp;mut pwr);\n\n    init_executor!( 1024 );\n\n    // NOTE: This is *not* the HAL Timer\n    let mut tim15 = crate::timer::Timer::tim15(device.TIM15, clocks, &amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n\n    // NOTE: Since this is *not* the HAL timer, I have to color\n    //       outside the lines to enable/reset the apb2\n    unsafe {\n        (&amp;(*RCC::ptr()).apb2enr).modify(|_,w| w.tim15en().set_bit());\n        (&amp;(*RCC::ptr()).apb2rstr).modify(|_,w| w.tim15rst().set_bit());\n        (&amp;(*RCC::ptr()).apb2rstr).modify(|_,w| w.tim15rst().clear_bit());\n    }\n\n    AsyncTimer::initialize(tim15);\n\n    let mut gpioa = device.GPIOA.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n    let mut ld1 = gpioa\n        .pa5\n        .into_push_pull_output(&amp;mut gpioa.moder, &amp;mut gpioa.otyper);\n\n    spawn(\"ld1\", async move {\n        loop {\n            ld1.set_high().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(1000u32)).await;\n            ld1.set_low().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(1000u32)).await;\n        }\n    });\n\n    let mut gpiob = device.GPIOB.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n    let mut ld2 = gpiob\n        .pb14\n        .into_push_pull_output(&amp;mut gpiob.moder, &amp;mut gpiob.otyper);\n\n    spawn(\"ld2\", async move {\n        loop {\n            ld2.set_high().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(500u32)).await;\n            ld2.set_low().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(500u32)).await;\n        }\n    });\n\n    executor::run_forever();\n}\n\nWhat's it do?\nIt blinks two LEDs. One is on/off every second, the other is on/off every half second.\nThe two calls to spawn are using my executor to start two async contexts. They don't\ndo a dang thing until executor::run_forever() is called, which starts both.\nIf we view them as two independent tasks, they first turn on their LED. Then they\ncall an async function named delay(...) with the amount of time they want to wait.\nThat call itself will return a future immediately, which is a pretty poor delay.\nBut once we .await on that future, from each task's point-of-view, it's a blocking\ncall for 1000 (or 500) milliseconds.\nOnce the .await is satisfied, the task can carry on, toggling it's LED and doing\nthe delay(...) dance again.\nSince the .await does not actually block the entire processor though, it allows\nthe other task to keep churning, itself doing real work or possibly .awaiting.\n\n  \nHow's it different from a non-async delay?\nFirst, this delay supports many individual delays using a single hardware timer.\nAdditionally, the normal Embedded HAL CountDown timers may use the nb non-blocking\ncrate, but they ultimately block when you wish to delay.\nWhen you have bit of code spinning in a loop checking to see if its delay has expired,\nyou're preventing other code from doing real work. You're also actively using the\nprocessor, which may prevent some low-power modes. If you have a low-power timer\navailable to you, there's a high chance that your MCU could go to sleep for 499 milliseconds,\nwake up to flip an LED, and then go back to sleep.\nConclusion\nOf course, you can write code that blinks two LEDs using interrupts and shared \nresources, but at least to my eye, having self-contained tasks with ostensibly\nstraight-line logic is easier to think about.\nIn this implementation, I've glossed over a few facts. First, there is an \ninterrupt-handler (for TIM15) wired up in order for the shared AsyncTimer\nto know when some deadline has expired. Additionally, the executor I'm using\ncurrently supports exactly 8 tasks, and I've initialized it with 1kb of memory\nfor storing the async continuation structures that Rust creates behind the\nscenes. \nAlso, if you want to create something that is asynchronous, you take on the\nsynchronization burden and end up writing implementations of Future which,\nwhile being straight-forward, is also non-trivial.  Using existing async \nfunctionality is much easier.\nAnother minor point is that async functions you've called generally won't actually\nattempt to make progress (in most cases) until you call .await. In the\ncase of our AsyncDelay though, that's not completely true. Calling delay(...)\nregisters a deadline, so it is \"working\" towards it.\nBut in general, I find async embedded code to show much promise, and could\nultimately form the basis for a reactive or actor-like framework for your small\nboards.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-async/","title":"Rust and Async (on embedded devices)"},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-lora/":{"body":"LoRa is a low power long range wireless protocol that operates in a lower frequency spectrum than WiFi, ZigBee and Bluetooth. This enables IoT use cases not possible with the shorter range technologies. And, you can use Rust!\n\nIn the LoRa stack, you have a LoRa node talking to LoRaWAN gateways, talking to a cloud service. Multiple LoRaWAN Gateways operate as a network, and a LoRa node can reach a gateway several kilometers away. The gateways are connected to a network server provided by companies such as The Things Industries which offer a free plan as part of The Things Network (TTN).\nLoRa Gateways\nYou can get gateways with different capabilities and production-readiness, but if you don't mind tinkering a bit, the RAK831 Gateway expansion for the Raspberry Pi is a good start. There are several options listed here. \nOnce you have a gateway-capable device, you may configure the gateway to connect to and forward packets to a network server. The original packet forwarder from Semtech is UDP-based and does not support any authentication or encryption of data. For this reason, it is being replaced by different alternative protocols, such as TTN, or one from the ChirpStack architecture. Either way, what you end up using depends on the gateway you have and what it can support. \nFor my usage, I decided to use the original UDP packet forwarder from Semtech, as the downsides were not that important for my initial experiments. There are several guides for setting up the RAK811 on a RaspBerry Pi out there, so I won't cover that part.\nLoRa Network\nOne of the nice things with LoRa is that you can control both the gateway and the network server, as there are open source servers that you can self-host. However, for getting started it might be be easier to connect to some existing network server that offers device management for you.\nIn my initial experiments, I created an account at TTN, and registered my gateway. So if you happen to live in my area within the range of my gateway and have a TTN application, you should be able to connect to TTN via my gateway, which is an interesting way to developing network coverage with private citizens acting as telcos.\n\nOnce the gateway is registered, you can create an application. In LoRa, an application is a way to group devices allowing them to share credentials using the application EUI (unique identifier) and an application key (secret). The application also registered a handler, which is located in TTNs datacenter where sensor data will eventually be sent.\n\nOnce the application is registered, you can register one or more devices for that application. A device needs to be activated either using OTAA (Over The Air Activation) or using ABP (Activation By Personalization). With OTAA there is a handshake between the device and the network using the application EUI and secret in order to derive the session key. With ABP, there is not handshake and the session key is hardcoded. Therefore, OTAA is regarded as more secure, but requires the network server to support the handshaking.\nThe device is identified by its own EUI (unique identifier) in the same was as an application, but there is not per-device key.\n\nWith this, the network configuration is complete, and we can proceed with configuring the LoRa node.\nLoRa Node\nLoRa nodes also comes in several configurations, but personally I have only used the RAK811-class of devices, which out of the box have an AT command firmware available to talk to the Semtech SX127x LoRa radio.\nFor my initial exploration into LoRa and Rust, I ordered a micro:bit breakout board from Pi Supply that supports the micro:bit connector, which makes it easy to get started.\n\nTo be able to communicate with the RAK811 firmware, I started the drogue-rak811 driver crate, that aims to provide a good interface for working with the RAK811 AT firmware using the embedded_hal serial traits.\nThe firmware on the breakout board is outdated, so keep in mind that the the AT command set supported by the RAK811 module is slightly outdated compared to the latest firmware. At present the driver only supports the 2.x version of the AT command firmware, so contributions for the 3.x firmware is welcome.\nThe complete example for this post can be found here.\nConfiguring the device\nAt first, the UART must be configured and handed to the driver:\nlet uarte = Uarte::new(\n    ctx.device.UARTE0,\n    Pins {\n        txd: port0.p0_01.into_push_pull_output(Level::High).degrade(),\n        rxd: port0.p0_13.into_floating_input().degrade(),\n        cts: None,\n        rts: None,\n    },\n    Parity::EXCLUDED,\n    Baudrate::BAUD115200,\n);\n\nlet (uarte_tx, uarte_rx) = uarte\n    .split(ctx.resources.tx_buf, ctx.resources.rx_buf)\n    .unwrap();\n\n\nlet driver = rak811::Rak811Driver::new(\n    uarte_tx,\n    uarte_rx,\n    port1.p1_02.into_push_pull_output(Level::High).degrade(),\n)\n.unwrap();\n\nlog::info!(\"Driver initialized\");\n\nIn order to connect to the gateway, the LoRa node needs to be configured with the following:\n\nFrequency band - This depends on where you live. In my case, its 868 Mhz.\nMode of operation - This can either be LoRa P2P which allows the node to send and receive data directly from another LoRa node, or LoRaWAN which connects the node to a gateway.\n\nThe driver can be used to configure the properties in this way:\ndriver.set_band(rak811::LoraRegion::EU868).unwrap();\ndriver.set_mode(rak811::LoraMode::WAN).unwrap();\n\nIn addition, the following settings from the TTN console must be set:\n\nDevice EUI \nApplication EUI\nApplication Key\n\ndriver.set_device_eui(&amp;[0x00, 0xBB, 0x7C, 0x95, 0xAD, 0xB5, 0x30, 0xB9]).unwrap();\ndriver.set_app_eui(&amp;[0x70, 0xB3, 0xD5, 0x7E, 0xD0, 0x03, 0xB1, 0x84])\n// Secret generated by TTN\ndriver .set_app_key(&amp;[0x00]).unwrap();\n\nThen, we can join the network and send our first packet!\ndriver.join(rak811::ConnectMode::OTAA).unwrap();\n\n// Port number can be between 1 and 255\ndriver.send(rak811::QoS::Confirmed, 1, b\"hello!\").unwrap();\n\nAnd, we should see data showing in the TTN console:\n\nAnd thats how to get started with LoRa in Rust.\nConclusion\nIn this post we have introduced the different concepts within the LoRa architecture. We have then seen how you can use a driver for the RAK811 AT command firmware to enable LoRa capabilities for your device, using Rust. We have also seen how to configure The Things Network to work with a custom LoRa gateway and node.\nFuture work\nBut wait, where is drogue-cloud in all this? And indeed, this is a missing piece of the puzzle right now, and the howto will be described in a future blog post. In short, you create an integration in the TTN console and point it to an HTTP or MQTT endpoint of drogue-cloud. In 2021, we plan on making drogue-cloud integrate with services such as TTN (using their APIs) in a seamless way that allows a unified experience for device management and telemetry/event data flowing to/from TTN and drogue-cloud. In an even more distant future, we could potentially add a LoRa Network Server to drogue-cloud, giving users full control of their IoT backend.\nAs mentioned earlier, the firmware supported by the driver is not the latest, and there are some changes in the AT command set in newer versions. The driver should be updated to support both formats, which can be deduced by querying the module for the firmware version.\nAlthough sending data to a LoRaWAN network is working, I was not able to get the driver to receive data from the network. This should normally happen by the gateway transmitting any pending data to the node whenever the node is sending new data. According to the AT command documentation, the firmware should send additional data as events to the driver, but this is not happening. At present, I have not debugged this enough to know if the problem is with the gateway or the node.\nThere are also other LoRa devices and boards out there, and adding support for those would help increase adoption of Rust for LoRa.

Lets see how we can hook it up to the cloud!\n\nVersion 1.x of the kit features a nRF51822 micro-controller, a motion sensor, accelerometer, and a 5x5 LED matrix. The recently released v2.0 upgrades the micro-controller to an nRF52833, which gives twice the flash and the RAM in addition to a speaker and microphone.\nIn this post, you will see how to get started using Rust on the micro:bit. We'll expose the on-chip thermometer as a Bluetooth Environment Sensing Service, and write a small application (in rust, duh), that polls the sensor for data and publishes it to the Drogue Cloud via a Bluetooth gateway.\nThe micro:bit does not have a lot of RAM (only 16k!), so we won't be doing any fancy encryption just yet.\n\nThe micro-controller\nThe nRF family of microcontrollers are generally built for 2.4 GHz low power radio, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee/802.15.4 and some proprietary protocols.\nUnlike some other BLE chips, the nRF 51 and 52 families used in the micro:bit runs the BLE stack alongside the application code in different parts of memory. Nordic Semiconductor (the company making the nRF) provides a proprietary firmware with the BLE implementation that you can use. However, you are also free to use that memory for something else, or provide your own BLE stack (and that is what we will do in this blog post). The advantage of this design is power saving since there is less active circuitry needed to operate the microcontroller. THe disadvantage is that you have to deal with flashing the BLE firmware as well and have to use an in-memory interface for communicating with the BLE controller.\nBluetooth Low Energy is a wireless network technology aimed at low-power applications. The advantage is that devices can operate on coin cell batteries for a long time while still providing some functionality. The BLE standard is huge, and is a bit special in that it covers a lot of what one would consider the 'application layer' standards such as standard formats for thermometers, heart rate monitors, audio and more. The advantage is that BLE-compatible software can work with BLE-compatible hardware from multiple vendors.\nRust and BLE\nFor BLE on nRF using Rust, there are two options:\n\nUse the rust bindings for the nRF firmware.\nThe rubble project, which is an open source pure rust implementation of the BLE standard. It's important to note that the rubble stack has not gone through the Bluetooth Qualification Process, so you cannot make bluetooth-based products with it at present.\n\nIn this post, we'll use rubble, because open source is the one true way.\nConnecting to the cloud\nTo connect BLE devices to the cloud, some sort of gateway software is needed. There are alternatives like Eclipse Kura that provides a lot of functionality.\nWe'll use a proof of concept drogue-bluetooth-gateway, which should work out of the box on most Linux distributions. The idea is that this can run on a gateway device like Raspberry PI and forward data to the cloud. The gateway talks to the bluetooth daemon (BlueZ) using DBus, and needs to run as a priviledged container.\nTo deploy the cloud, have a look at drogue-cloud which you can run locally on minikube.\nThe code\nThe example used in this blog post can be found at the drogue-microbit repository. This repository contains some libraries and example applications for the micro:bit based on the nrf-hal. An alternative crate to use is the microbit crate, which re-exports on nrf-hal + some libraries.\nThe example uses RTIC, which provides a useful abstraction for writing embedded rust application.\nConfiguring the BLE stack\nRubble needs to be configured with:\n\nAn implementation of a Transmitter trait. Rubble comes with a BleRadio type that consumes the radio device as well as TX/RX packet buffers.\nA timer that is used to drive the link layer state. The micro:bit features a timer that we can use for this purpose.\nA set of buffers and queues which is used to pass data between the radio, link layer and attribute protocol.\nA BLE channel mapper that exposes attributes that map to the GATT service we're implementing.\n\npub enum AppConfig {}\nimpl Config for AppConfig {\n    type Timer = BleTimer&lt;hal::pac::TIMER0&gt;;\n    type Transmitter = BleRadio;\n    type ChannelMapper = BleChannelMap&lt;EnvironmentSensingService, NoSecurity&gt;;\n    type PacketQueue = &amp;'static mut SimpleQueue;\n}\n\nThe BLE service that most closely matches our use case is the Environment Sensing Service, so we'll use that. It allows exposing different types of environment data such as temperature, humiditiy along with some metadata. In theory, an application relying on this standard can be interoperable with any device implementing this service.\nlet ess: EnvironmentSensingService = EnvironmentSensingService::new();\n\nlet ble_r = Responder::new(tx, rx, L2CAPState::new(BleChannelMap::with_attributes(ess)));\n\nIn order for a BLE device to be known to the world, it must advertise its existence. It does so by broadcasting advertisements, so that those interested can discover it. The broadcast is done at regular intervals, usually called the advertisement interval. In the example application it's set to 100 milliseconds, which makes it pretty easy to discover. The advertisement also contains some metadata about the broadcaster, in our case a name of the device along with the UUIDs corresponding to the service that the device supports.\nlet next_update = ble_ll.start_advertise(\n        Duration::from_millis(100),\n        &amp;[\n            AdStructure::CompleteLocalName(\"Drogue IoT micro:bit\"),\n            AdStructure::ServiceUuids16(ServiceUuids::from_uuids(true, &amp;[ESS_UUID])),\n        ],\n        &amp;mut radio,\n        tx_cons,\n        rx_prod,\n    )\n    .unwrap();\nble_ll.timer().configure_interrupt(next_update);\n\nRubble needs to act on RADIO interrupts to handle received data.\n#[task(binds = RADIO, resources = [radio, ble_ll], spawn = [ble_worker], priority = 3)]\nfn radio(ctx: radio::Context) {\n    ...\n}\n\nIt also requires to ensure that connection events can be processed at regular intervals.\n#[task(binds = TIMER0, resources = [radio, ble_ll], spawn = [ble_worker], priority = 3)]\nfn timer0(ctx: timer0::Context) {\n    ...\n}\n\nBoth of these spawn another task which does all the work:\nwhile ble_r.has_work() {\n    ble_r.process_one().unwrap();\n}\n\nThis can in theory run in the idle loop as well, but this way it is only run when needed (via radio or timer interrupts).\nMeasuring the temperature\nTo avoid conflict with the RADIO and TIMER0 interrupts, a Real Time Counter (RTC) is used to periodically measure the temperature\nand update the temperature state of the environment sensing service. The temperature is measured by first starting the measurement, then waiting for a while to\nmake sure the value is stable, then reading the value and stopping the measurement.\n#[task(binds = RTC0, resources = [rtc, thermometer, timer_count, ble_r], priority = 1)]\nfn rtc0(ctx: rtc0::Context) {\n\n    ...\n\n    if *timer_count % 2 == 0 {\n        thermometer.start_measurement();\n    } else {\n        let value = thermometer.read();\n        value.map_or_else(\n        |_| {},\n        |value| {\n                // Our calibration shows that it is off by 4 degrees...\n                let f = value.to_num::&lt;u32&gt;() - 4;\n                ble_r.lock(|ble_r| {\n                    let l2cap = &amp;mut *(ble_r.l2cap());\n                    let provider: &amp;mut EnvironmentSensingService =\n                        l2cap.channel_mapper().attribute_provider();\n                    provider.set_temperature(f);\n                });\n            },\n        );\n        thermometer.stop_measurement();\n    }\n}\n\nRunning the application\nIf you've connected the micro:bit to your PC, you can flash your device using cargo embed --release. This will start up a console printing log messages from the firmware:\n\nConnecting and reading the data\nTo run the gateway, you need to have podman or docker installed. You can run the gateway using a prebuilt container image:\ndocker run --privileged --volume /run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/run/dbus/system_bus_socket --net=host -e RUST_LOG=info -e DROGUE_HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://http-endpoint.drogue-iot.172.18.0.2.nip.io:30394 -e DROGUE_USERNAME=ble_gw -e DROGUE_PASSWORD=foobar -e BLUETOOTH_DEVICE=B9:64:39:0E:8E:DF -ti quay.io/lulf/drogue-bluetooth-gateway:latest\n\nYou can find the address in the console output from the device. The gateway should be able to connect to your device and publish data to the cloud:\n\nIf the gateway is able to connect to your device, we can see some output in the drogue console:\n\nAnd thats it! \nWhats next\nWe've seen how you can develop open source BLE applications in rust on the BBC micro:bit and sending telemetry data to the cloud via a BLE gateway. However, we have only scratched the surface of what you can do with it There are more interesting sensors on the micro:bit to play with, like the motion sensor and the mic/speaker on the v2.\nThe rubble stack is not completely reliable, and difficulties connecting to the device and disconnects does occur. Working out the root cause for these issues would improve the relability of the example.\nThere are several alternatives to use as BLE gateways, such as Eclipse Kura that it could be interesting to try. It would also be nice to have support for 6LoWPAN in rubble, so that BLE devices can be directly connected using IPv6.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-microbit/","title":"Rust on the BBC micro:bit"},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-embedded-layer-cake/":{"body":"As noted in the first post, I'm working towards doing more IoT using Rust\nin an embedded ARM Cortex-M world.  Thankfully, the Rust compiler leverages\nLLVM and can target quite a few different processors. \nInstruction Sets &amp; Processors\nThat being said, there are quite a few different processors even within the \nCortex-M family.  They all have mostly similar instruction sets, which makes \nthe generation of the executable pretty straightforward (for the compiler).\nBut each processor contains different amounts of flash memory (where the \nprogram is stored) and different amounts of RAM (used during the execution\nof the program).\nThe ARM processors are different than you might have experienced with the\nIntel and AMD processors, because ARM is licensed intellectual property\nwhere a multitude of manufacturers can create their own processor, mostly\nfollowing ARM's specifications. \nPeripherals\nOne of the largest sources of variety is in the peripherals within the\nprocessor. With desktop machines, we think of peripherals as \"a display\"\nor \"an external harddrive\" or \"a mouse\". Within an embedded processor,\na perhipheral is lower-level, embodying things like timers and SPI busses\nand serial port thingies.\nEach of these peripherals is interacted with by code through one or more\nregisters, which is a byte (or two or four) of memory within the processor.\nThese registers get memory mapped into the normal RAM-addressable memory\nthat code can operate upon.\nFor instance, within the STM32F401 processor from STMicroelectronics,\nthere are a few registers for configuring and interacting with the USART\n(a \"serial port\"). Some bits of the registers control the baud rate, stop-bits,\nand parity of the underlying serial bus. Other registers are used to transfer\noctets from your code to the serial bus and to receive octets from the serial bus\ninto your code. Additional registers are used to communicate if errors have \noccurred while attempting to move data across (overruns, parity errors, noise).\nThe reference manuals for processors describe the memory location and semantics\nof each bit/byte of each register for each peripheral. \n\nWorking with memory addresses and bitwise manipulation of these registers\nwould be... challenging.\nPeripheral Access Crates (PAC)\nThankfully, some producers of ARM Cortex-M chips also ship a related XML file\ncalled an SVD (System View Descriptor). These files take the prose information\nfrom the reference manuals and makes it machine-readable. Tooling in the Rust\ncommunity, called svd2rust can consume\nthese files and produce Rust code so we can use friendly name to manipulate registers.\nThe result of using svd2rust is what's called a peripheral access crate, or PAC.\nOne example is the stm32f4 crate.\nOnce you have a PAC, you can at least write slightly better-looking code, but\nyou are still thinking in terms of registers, bits and bytes. A PAC doesn't quite\nget you up to the semantics of a serial port thingy.\nHardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)\nWhile different silicon manufacturers produce similar but different ARM Cortex-M\nchips, using possibly different registers to accomplish things, at the end of the day,\nmany still have serial port thingies (e.g. a USART).\nTo begin to bring commonality across the chips, there's a hardware abstraction layer (HAL).\nThe HAL is created in two parts. First is the common embedded-hal\nwhich defines abstractions such as how to read or write to a serial port.\nNote, it does not define an abstraction for serial port itself, since the configuration\nand setup of a serial port is still quite chip-specific. But assuming you've configured\na port, embedded-hal gives us a common way to read octets or write octets (or words,\nor whatever size data the specific port supports).\nThe embedded-hal is purely a crate of Rust traits, and by itself is not functional.\nHumans create a HAL implementation for a specific bit of silicon using the\ngenerated PAC in order to provide a friendly way of interacting with different chips.\nFor instance, there's the stm32f4xx-hal\nHAL crate which has been lovingly hand-crafted, using the stm32f PAC\nin order to safely configure and use a chip from the STM32F4 family of silicon.\nThe HAL includes plenty of bits that don't map to the embedded-hal traits, because\nactivities such as setting up the serial port thingy is outside of scope for embedded-hal,\nbut it also does mix in the embedded-hal traits where the functionality overlaps.\nSafety\nOne benefit Rust HALs have over other HALs based on other languages is the safety\nthat can be provided using zero cost abstractions.\nTake, for instance, on the STM32F401 chip, one of the serial port thingies (USART6) \ncan be connected to a couple of different sets of pins. Since each chip tends to ultimately\nhave more peripherals than can be surfaced through physical pins, a lot of pins can\nperform one of several functions. \nIn the case of USART6, the transmission line can be attached to pin PA11 or PC6.\nPC6 could alternatively be configured for usage with i2c or SDIO. Until you\nexplicitly configure the pin for usage as the USART6 transmission line, the HAL\nwill not allow you to use it to further configure the USART6 serial port thingy.\nIn my case, I've wired up my serial port device to pins PA11 for transmission (tx)\nand PA12 for receiving (rx).\nFirst I get the HAL representation of the GPIO pins, the little bits of metal sticking\nout of my board:\nlet gpioa = device.GPIOA.split();\n\nThen I select off the two pins I need for my USART:\nlet pa11 = gpioa.pa11;\nlet pa12 = gpioa.pa12;\n\nAt this point, pa11 and pa12 are of type PA11&lt;Input&lt;Floating&gt;&gt; and\nPA12&lt;Input&lt;Floating&gt;&gt; respectively. Two floating digital input pins is\nnot sufficient for usage as a serial point. In their initial natural state,\nI could use them to sense voltage changes, as digital inputs, but I cannot\nharness the internal USART peripheral that may be attached to them.\nSo next, I configure the processor to know I specifically want to use them for USART6 \ninstead of any of the other usages they could have. The into_alternative_af8() is \nhow I tell the processor (through the PAC) that I intend to use them as USART6:\nlet tx_pin = pa11.into_alternate_af8();\nlet rx_pin = pa12.into_alternate_af8();\n\nBehind the scenes, the HAL is using the PAC to twiddle the appropriate bits\nin the appropriate registers to configure the pointy bits of metal sticking\nout of the board and what the processor thinks I intend to do with them.\nNow, the types of tx_pin and rx_pin are PA11&lt;Alternate&lt;AF8&gt;&gt; and\n&lt;PA12&lt;Alternate&lt;AF8&gt;&gt; respectively. I can't use them a simple digital I/O\npins now, because Rust has consumed the generic pins and returned me USART-configured\npins.\nI can finally use the HAL method to configure my serial port thingy:\nlet mut serial = Serial::usart6(\n            usart6,\n            (tx_pin, rx_pin),\n            ... \n            ...);\n\nThe usart6(...) function will only accept appropriate configured pins which\nare usable as USART6. The compiler will not let me use arbitrary pins, or even\ncorrect pins that haven't been fully configured.\nNow, though, our serial implements the Read&lt;...&gt; and Write&lt;...&gt; traits\nfrom embedded-hal and can be handed off to an actual device driver that\nis written purely from the point-of-view of embedded-hal. \nThe device driver doesn't need to know which vendor's silicon I'm using, just that\nthere's now an object that can be written to and read from.\nFinally...\nEmbedded coding is hard, especially when you're not stupendously experienced doing it.\nOn the other hand, using Rust provides a nice set of abstractions and a ton of guardrails\nto prevent you from flying off the cliff of correct code.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-embedded-layer-cake/","title":"Rust Embedded Layer Cake"},"https://blog.drogue.io/secure-device-to-cloud/":{"body":"As we all know, the S in IoT stands for security. However, one reason IoT has a bad security track record is that it consumes a lot of resources and is not that easy to setup. One piece of this puzzle is having good client side libraries for doing TLS. Read on to learn more about how you can secure your device to cloud communication.\nWhat are the options?\nThere are no one solution fits all, and requirements for a hobby project is very likely different from installation in a secure facility. The approaches we've tried out so far is:\n\nNo security - for hobby projects where you're just reporting temperature values to the cloud, security might not seem to be a big deal. However, if you're sending that data to some cloud service, chances are that the cloud service want your device to present some credentials. Since sending unencrypted credentials over a public network is a bad idea, this option is only viable in cases where you control the entire network where no one can sniff traffic. \nSecured gateway to cloud - If you have a private network where you don't worry about someone sniffing out your credentials, you have the option of installing a local gateway or running a service on an existing gateway which forwards data over an encrypted link to a cloud service. This is useful if your device just cannot do encrypted traffic and you can be certain no one is sniffing credentials.\nSecure device to cloud - This requires your device to be capable of encrypting data, potentially supporting a standardized protocol like TLS (Transport Layer Security).\n\nWe'll explore the two latter options in this post.\nSecured gateway to cloud\nIf you have a too little RAM to do TLS on the device, and you are on a secure network, then you can setup a gateway between the device and cloud. One way to do that is to use HAProxy, which is fairly simple to setup. \nHere is an example configuration that you can append to the HAProxy config for proxying Device -http-&gt; HAProxy -https -&gt; Drogue Cloud:\n#---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# main frontend which devices connect to\n#---------------------------------------------------------------------\nfrontend main\n    bind *:80\n    default_backend drogue\n\n#---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Drogue IoT backend\n#---------------------------------------------------------------------\nbackend drogue\n    balance      roundrobin\n    http-request set-header  Host http.sandbox.drogue.cloud\n    server       static      http.sandbox.drogue.cloud:443 check sni str(http.sandbox.drogue.cloud) ssl\n\nThe frontend configuration configures the incoming port bound to where devices can connect. The backend configuration \nconfigures the route to the Drogue IoT sandbox service. For the requests to be routed correctly, the HTTP Host header and the TLS Server Name (SNI) must be set to the destination host.\nSecured device to cloud\nDoing TLS on devices is the preferred approach if you have the available RAM. Unfortunately, to use TLS in Rust embedded, is has been necessary to \"pollute\" your Rust project with an existing TLS library like mbed TLS, which is the old approach taken by drogue-tls.\nWe've started a new implementation of TLS 1.3 in pure Rust (nicknamed BobTLS after the initial author), and replaced the mbedTLS-based version. The goal is to implement the TLS 1.3 specification in pure Rust, with async support. The project does not have any dependencies on other Drogue IoT projects, and can be used with any TCP stack, by implementing two traits used for I/O. In fact, there are implementations of these traits for some common runtimes, and you can find examples of using Drogue TLS with tokio and embassy + smoltcp, with trait implementations for futures I/O traits as well.\nThe project is still under development, but implements basic functionality to get connected to Drogue IoT Cloud, such as Server Name Indication (SNI) extension. Critical features such as certificate validation and client certificate authentication is still on the TODO list. \nWhy TLS 1.3?\nTLS 1.3 is simpler and easier to implement than TLS 1.2. This is partially because there are only a single cipher suite that needs implementing (TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256), which is also not too resource demanding for embedded devices, but also because there are fewer mandatory extensions.\nWhere does my RAM go?\nWe've tried to keep the memory footprint of drogue-tls small. The overhead of a TLS connection is minimal, and correlates with the desired buffer size. To properly support any TLS compliant endpoint, the chosen buffer size should be at least the maximum TLS frame size, 16kB. However, if you know your application will not be sending much data, you can get away with less. Given the focus on embedded, the primary goal has been to make it small rather than fast.\nSince Drogue TLS is built using async, the futures also require some stack allocation. However, since embassy uses static futures for the tasks, we know the memory usage at compile time (BSS).\nAs an example, memory usage of embassy + smoltcp binary, compile to the x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target, looks like this without TLS:\n$ size target/release/ping-embassy-net\n   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename\n1094295   42040   16880 1153215  1198bf target/release/ping-embassy-net\n\nWhereas with TLS enabled using a 16 kB record buffer, the memory usage increases (difference shown in the last row).\n$ size target/release/ping-embassy-net\n   text     data     bss      dec     hex filename\n1175083    44392   37296  1256771  132d43 target/release/ping-embassy-net\n     8%       5%    2.2x       8%\n\nAlthough the BSS increases to 2.2x, the 16kB is a large fraction of that increase. The BSS overhead of the library itself is about 4 kB when enabling TLS with a 16 kB record buffer. The same overhead can be observed when compiling to ARM architectures.\nWe have not yet look at flash usage, so there are probably improvements to be made there as well.\nWhat about Drogue Device?\nDrogue Device now supports TLS, and the example using micro:bit + ESP8266 WiFi is now using Drogue TLS to connect directly to the sandbox.\nWe want Drogue Device to provide a simple way to get started with IoT, so having a simple API to use networking is important. As an example, the following code joins the wifi network, creates a regular Socket before wrapping it in a TlsSocket which implements the same trait as a regular Socket.\nlet mut wifi = device.wifi.mount((), spawner);\nwifi.join(Join::Wpa {\n    ssid: WIFI_SSID,\n    password: WIFI_PSK,\n})\n.await\n.expect(\"Error joining wifi\");\nlog::info!(\"WiFi network joined\");\n\nstatic mut TLS_BUFFER: [u8; 16384] = [0; 16384];\nlet socket = Socket::new(wifi, wifi.open().await);\nlet socket = TlsSocket::wrap(socket,\n    TlsContext::new(rng,\n        unsafe { &amp;mut TLS_BUFFER }) // We guarantee buffer to only be used by TLS\n        .with_server_name(HOST));\n\nBecause they implement the same trait, it's easy to write logic that does not have to care about the connection being over TCP or TLS.\nFuture work\nAs mentioned, Drogue TLS is still under development, with some critical features missing. However, we hope to see interest from the community and hope to collaborate on improving the TLS support for Rust embedded.\nAnother piece of security we have not yet discussed is the security of the device itself. If the device is installed in a public location, you also need to make sure someone cannot simply connect to it physically and extract the credentials from flash. This is a topic on its own that we'll try to cover in a later post, but newer generation microcontrollers allow you to define secure areas of flash to prevent extraction of credentials.\nSummary\nIn this post we've gone through two options for securing device to cloud communication. One is by deploying a local gateway such as HAProxy to handle the secure communication. The other is to encrypt data on the device, using the new Drogue TLS library. Finally, we've seen how you can use Drogue TLS with Drogue Device.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/secure-device-to-cloud/","title":"(Re)introducing Drogue TLS"},"https://blog.drogue.io/the-book-workshops/":{"body":"Writing code is easy, writing documentation is hard.

Here is our approach. \nThe Book\nInstead of having multiple documentation sites, and multiple locations for the different released version, we wanted\nto have a single point for you to go to when it comes to documentation of Drogue IoT.

Today, everyone can do that. There are so many examples out there,\nthat show how to use a Raspberry Pi and push some data to a Mosquitto broker. I would argue, that this is nice, and cool,\nbut no IoT.\nMany IoT projects start with a simple PoC. A Raspberry Pi, a bit of script code, some backend process.

This may require you to implement some functionality on the device side, and on the backend side.\nWithout really knowing it, you implemented an HTTP server, simply for serving a static web page.\nSuddenly things get complicated\nThen, things tend to get much more complex than anticipated. Adding more devices also increases the number of devices\nyou need to manage. It also increases the number of messages that hit your backend system.

So you need to incorporate new protocols, new\ndata formats, and new use cases into your system, in order to keep your things running. And, the more devices you\nconnect, the more sense it makes to interconnect the data.\nThere a more problems to solve, but I don't want to scare you 😉\nWhat we need\nWe need something that allows the developer to focus on the actual use case, and not worry about IoT concerns.\nThis is important to remember in what comes next. Because our focus is not on the simplicity of solving a single\nIoT use case, but to provide a scalable, modular, and interoperable platform that allows you to implement all\ndifferent kinds of IoT use cases.\nKnative &amp; Cloud events\nKnative is a serverless framework for Kubernetes. And please, let's ignore the term\n\"serverless\" for the moment.\nKnative helps you build scalable microservices. If you are using Rust to implement them, a microservice starts up\nin milliseconds and consumes only a few megabytes of RAM. Knative also offers APIs around the use case of events\n(aka messages). Instead of using a messaging protocol like AMQP or MQTT, Knative builds on top of\nCloud Events.\nIn a nutshell, Cloud Events describes transport layers and data formats in order to transport events. For example,\nfor HTTP, that consists of a few HTTP headers, and the HTTP body being the actual payload. But cloud events can also be\nrepresented in different other technologies like HTTP, JSON, Kafka, AMQP, and more. Since there is a common data model,\nit is easy to translate between these different technologies.\nKnative eventing builds on top of that. Using Kubernetes custom resources, you can deploy event sources, sinks, and\nflows, and put translators between the steps. By default, Knative eventing uses the HTTP representation to exchange\nevents between services, but it is possible to use other representations as well. \nAs Knative is \"serverless\", it can easily scale down to zero, but also scale up as needed.\nEndpoints\nIn order to support the idea of being protocol agnostic, we provide different protocol endpoints. For a start we have\nHTTP (in multiple dialects) and MQTT (v3 and v5). The endpoints are rather small processes, and only translate\nbetween their protocol and the cloud events representation.\nThe endpoints are payload agnostic and stateless, they only forward what they receive to the next Knative event sink,\nand so they are pretty easy to implement.\nKafka\nAs there is a Kafka integration with Knative eventing, we are going to use that. The reason for that is simple: First of\nall, Kafka is known to scale well, so it fits our use case. Second, we can integrate with Kafka in two ways, using Knative\nor directly.\nWhenever we can, we try to use the Knative eventing APIs, trying to be interoperable and modular. However, we still\nhave ability to directly interface with Kafka, and leverage solutions that are more Kafka focused.\nAn example\nWe are in the middle of building this, and you can find an early start at\ndrogue-iot/drogue-cloud on GitHub. There isn't that much code, which is\ndue to fact that we are still missing some important functionality. But also, because we are leveraging technology\nthat already exists.\nNevertheless, we are trying to create some end-to-end examples as early as possible. A simple one, publishing a\ntemperature value, that ends up in a Grafana dashboard. A classic!\n\nWhen you take a look at this, please keep in mind what I wrote earlier: we are not trying to make this single,\ntrivial use case as simple as possible. We try to provide a more versatile solution, that lets you focus on\nimplementing a solution on top of IoT and that still allows you to scale, extend and adapt in the future.\nThe beauty with the Knative APIs is, that you can easily re-arrange your services. Instead of Kafka as\nchannel and source, you could to with some other implementation. Or directly connect the HTTP endpoint to the\n\"Influx DB pusher\". Or put some conversion in the middle, …\nWhat is next?\nIf you poke around in the repository, you will already find a few other things we are working on. However, I think this\nblog post is already long enough, but I also think the topic deserved a bit of introduction, just to explain what our\nmotivation is, and were we are heading to.\nSee also\n\ndrogue-cloud repository \nKnative\nCloud events\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/the-cloud-side-of-things/","title":"The cloud side of things"},"https://blog.drogue.io/websocket-integration/":{"body":"We recently added a websocket endpoint in drogue cloud, to easily get a stream of events for an application, using the well-known websocket protocol.\nLet's have a look and build a small demo apps to consume events. \nThe Websocket Integration service\nThe service is pretty straight forward in its design : it will connect to the appropriate Kafka topic for the application \nand forward any new events in the websocket. The events are pushed in their Cloud-events format, as text messages.\nGive it a try ! Opening a socket is as easy as : \nwebsocat wss://websocket-integration-drogue-dev.apps.wonderful.iot-playground.org/drogue-public-temperature\n\nAuthentication\nAs you can see we used authentication to open the websocket. The service accepts open ID tokens, API keys and nothing/anonymous (if your app is configured for public access).\nAuthorization requests are made with a \"read\" permission.\nAn openID token can be passed through the Authorization: Bearer header. Here using drg to get a token : \nwebsocat wss://websocket-integration.address/yourApplication -H=\"Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami -t)\"\n\nFor API keys you need to use the Basic header, where the password will be the API key. The header should look like this: \nAuthorization: Basic base64(your-username:your-api-key)\n\nShared consumption\nThe websocket integration service is built on top of the actix actors framework which makes mutlithreading a breeze, \nso you can confidently open multiple connections and don't suffer any slowdowns. \nTo give you more flexibility, the group_id query parameter enables shared consumption.\nGrouping clients will result in the events split evenly between members of a group. \nThe url would look like this:\nwss://websocket-integration.address/yourApp?group_id=myGroup\n\nIf two clients connect using \"myGroup\" then each will receive every other message. \nIf you have an application generating a lot of traffic it's easy to split the load between different consumers.\nBuild an app !\nA CLI tool is great for testing, but not an ideal base for a consuming application.\nLet's build a small application using rust and connect it to our websocket integration service. \nThis example connects to a public application, so there is no need for credentials.\nNow we have everything we need, let's write some code. We'll use the great tungstenite crate for the websocket functionality :\nuse anyhow::{anyhow, Context, Result};\nuse tungstenite::connect;\nuse tungstenite::http::{header, Request};\nuse url::Url;\n\npub fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n    // Here are our connection details\n    let url = \"wss://websocket-integration-drogue-dev.apps.wonderful.iot-playground.org\";\n    let application = \"drogue-public-temperature\";\n    let url = format!(\"{}/{}\", url, application);\n\n    // And connect !\n    let (mut socket, response) = connect(Url::parse(url).unwrap()).context(\"Error connecting to the Websocket endpoint:\")?;\n    println!(\"Connected to websocket\");\n    println!(\"HTTP response code: {}\", response.status());\n\n    // Now we can simply poll the connection for new messages.\n    loop {\n        let msg = socket.read_message();\n        match msg {\n            Ok(m) =&gt; {\n                // ignore protocol messages, only show text\n                if m.is_text() {\n                    println!(\"{}\", m.into_text().expect(\"Invalid message\"));\n                }\n            }\n            Err(e) =&gt; break Err(anyhow!(e)),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAnd voilà, you are streaming events in your application ! This example is pretty basic, you should get fancy and add some async and authentication in there.\nIn the context of a long-running application, API key are a better fit than openID tokens. To create an API key in the console, browse the API &gt; Access keys section.\nYou can find a buildable cargo project that shows how to use the API token authentication here.\nA new tool for drg's arsenal\nWith the websocket service available we took the opportunity to add a stream subcommand to drg so you can quickly tap into a stream to do some debugging: \ndrg stream drogue-public-temperature\n\nThat's it ! If you have a default app already set in your context, then drg stream will fetch the application Id from there.\nWhat's next ?\nThe next stop is to be able to send commands back to your devices using the websocket other direction.\nExpect to see it in a later release ! \n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/websocket-integration/","title":"Introducing Websocket integration: another way to consume drogue events"},"https://blog.drogue.io/wifi-offload/":{"body":"My recent work has been around Cortex-M embedded development using Rust and RTIC.\nI'm using a handy little development board in the form of the STM Nucleo-F401RE.\nUnfortunately, it's handiness stops as soon as you want to communicate with TCP over WiFi, because it lacks WiFi.\n\nThere also exists another board (using an Xtensa chip) called an ESP8266.\nThe ESP is nice in that it contains a stock firmware that responds to Hayes AT commands (like a modem) and can do networky types of things.\nThen again, the ESP uses Hayes AT commands, which are ASCII-like, across a serial port, which is decidedly less networky feeling from the Rust end of the stick.\nembedded-nal (or Drogue-Network)\nThere exists an unpublished Rust crate called embedded-nal. \nThe \"nal\" stands for \"Network Abstraction Layer\". \nThis crate acts as an API and contains Rust traits that can be backed by implementations.\nConsider it to be akin to the socket-related bits of the POSIX standard.\nBy itself, it does nothing. \nBut with an implementation, higher-level drivers can be written regardless of the underlying networking stack.\nSince embedded-nal is not-yet-published, I've taken a non-agressive fork and published it as the drogue-network crate.\nLet's look at the traits...\nI'm initially only concerned wtih TCP, even though the crate also defines a UDP trait.\n/// This trait is implemented by TCP/IP stacks. You could, for example, have an implementation\n/// which knows how to send AT commands to an ESP8266 WiFi module. You could have another implemenation\n/// which knows how to driver the Rust Standard Library's `std::net` module. Given this trait, you can\n/// write a portable HTTP client which can work with either implementation.\npub trait TcpStack {\n\t/// The type returned when we create a new TCP socket\n\ttype TcpSocket;\n\t/// The type returned when we have an error\n\ttype Error: core::fmt::Debug;\n\n\t/// Open a new TCP socket.

wrapper that allows just that. \nCalling an immutable method on an immutable object is allowed, and internally the method, at runtime gets a\nmutable reference to something that does mutable work.\nWe'll return to that in a moment.\nLet's talk to our board...\nBefore we can implement a TcpStack, we need to be able to just have a conversation with our ESP8266 as it sits connected to our serial USART pins.\nAs we discussed in our last post, this involves some board-specific setup, where we:\n\nget the transmit and receive pins, and convince our F401RE that we want to use them for USART communication.\nget our pins which are connected to the ESP's enable and reset pins, and convince our F401RE that we want to be able to push them high or pull them low.\nuse some of those pins to setup a Serial port for USART6 running at 115,200bps.\nenable notifications for the RXNE (receive register not empty; data is ready for us) interrupt.\nand then split the serial port into 2 halfs: transmit and receive.\n\n// SERIAL pins for USART6\nlet tx_pin = pa11.into_alternate_af8();\nlet rx_pin = pa12.into_alternate_af8();\n\n// enable pin\nlet mut en = gpioc.pc10.into_push_pull_output();\n// reset pin\nlet mut reset = gpioc.pc12.into_push_pull_output();\n\nlet usart6 = device.USART6;\n\nlet mut serial = Serial::usart6(\n    usart6,\n    (tx_pin, rx_pin),\n    Config {\n        baudrate: 115_200.bps(),\n        parity: Parity::ParityNone,\n        stopbits: StopBits::STOP1,\n        ..Default::default()\n    },\n    clocks,\n).unwrap();\n\nserial.listen(nucleo_f401re::hal::serial::Event::Rxne);\nlet (tx, rx) = serial.split();\n\nBut right now all we have is a generic serial port pushing bytes back and forth, without any semantics applied.\nThankfully, we've created an ESP8266 driver, though, which can apply some semantics and gives us an easier-to-use way to interact.\nThe driver crate gives us an initialize(...) free function which consumes both halves of the serial port, along with the enable and reset pins, plus two queues.\nWhy two queues?\nThe ESP communicates over the serial port in 2 ways:\n\ncommand/response\nunsolicited messages\n\nThese responses and messages will be created from within the interrupt handler from bytes that have arrived and been interpreted, but consumed elsewhere.\nUsing a heapless Queue allows us to have lock-free Producer and Consumer to shuffle messages between the contexts.\n\nstatic mut RESPONSE_QUEUE: Queue&lt;Response, U2&gt; = Queue(i::Queue::new());\nstatic mut NOTIFICATION_QUEUE: Queue&lt;Response, U16&gt; = Queue(i::Queue::new());\n\nlet (adapter, ingress) = initialize(\n    tx, rx,\n    &amp;mut en, &amp;mut reset,\n    unsafe { &amp;mut RESPONSE_QUEUE },\n    unsafe { &amp;mut NOTIFICATION_QUEUE },\n).unwrap();\n\nNow we are holding two objects: an adapter which is the user-facing\nclient for interacting with the esp8266 wifi adapter, an an ingress which can be used from interrupt service routines to process inbound bytes.\nWiring up the interrupts\nAs noted above, we're using RTIC. \nRTIC provides a place to do your initialization, and an easy way to wire up interrupt handlers and scheduled tasks, with priorities.\nIt also provides a way to share resources between these different contexts. \nSo at the end of our initializtion process, we stuff the objects into the shared-resources object and return it:\ninit::LateResources {\n    adapter: Some(adapter),\n    ingress,\n}\n\nIngress bytes\nWhen commands are transmitted (via our client adapter), the ESP8266 will trigger the USART6 interrupt for every byte that gets sent back to us.\nThankfully, our ingress object is designed to accept those bytes, so it's quick to wire it up to the interrupt:\n#[task(binds = USART6, priority = 10, resources = [ingress])]\nfn usart(ctx: usart::Context) {\n    if let Err(b) = ctx.resources.ingress.isr() {\n        info!(\"failed to ingress {}\", b as char);\n    }\n}\n\nWith RTIC, the highest priority task using a resource can use it lock-free, because it can interrupt any other task.\nSo we just call the isr() method on our ingress which reads a byte and adds it to an internal buffer.\nInterrupt service routines should be fast, because they might be called a lot. \nIn this case, for every byte that arrives at potentially 115,200bps.\nProcess bytes\nSince the ingressing of bytes needs to be fast, all it does is put it on a buffer and return. \nBut at some point, we need to digest those bytes and determine if they are meaningful, or if we're still waiting on more.\nFor this digesting, we set up a recurring scheduled task, which we schedule the first time from our initialization,\nand then it infinitely reschedules itself.\nconst DIGEST_DELAY: u32 = 100;\n\n#[task(schedule = [digest], priority = 2, resources = [ingress])]\nfn digest(mut ctx: digest::Context) {\n    ctx.resources.ingress.lock(|ingress| ingress.digest());\n    ctx.schedule.digest(ctx.scheduled + (DIGEST_DELAY * 100_000).cycles())\n        .unwrap();\n}\n\nIt's using the same ingress resource, but at a lower priority than the USART, so when it fires, it could conceivably\nbe interrupted by the USART interrupt. By locking the ingress object, we can disable that interrupt for a moment and\ncall our digest() method.\nThe digest() method attempts to parse the internal buffer, and figures out if it represents a response to a previously-issued command\nor an unsolicited message, and if so, it builds a Response object and puts it on the appropriate Queue using its Producer.\nWhere's the WiFi, bucko?\nYeah, we're still not doing WiFi or sockets, are we? \nLet's do that now.\nIn the idle portion of the app, we can use the adapter and magically transform it into a TcpStack implementation.\nFirst, since we're going to be transforming our adapter into something else, we'll be mutating it. \nSo we have to take() it from the Some(T) that is holding it on the shared resources, which replaces\nit with a None.\nNext we use it directly to connect to our WiFi. Behind the scenes, calling 'join(...) for instance\nwill transmit an AT command, and the response will come back through the USART interrupt and be digested\nby the digest task, seemingly in a multi-threaded sort of way. It's not really multi-threaded, the processor\njust keeps iterrupting our idle code and itself until a response occurs and our idle code is allowed to proceed.\nFinally we can into_network_stack() our adapter, which consumes the adapter and gives us back a \nTcpStack implementation. Hooray!\n#[idle(resources = [adapter])]\nfn idle(ctx: idle::Context) -&gt; ! {\n\n    let mut adapter = ctx.resources.adapter.take().unwrap();\n\n    let result = adapter.get_firmware_info();\n    info!(\"firmware: {:?}\", result);\n\n    let result = adapter.join(\"oddly\", \"mywifipassword\");\n    info!(\"joined wifi {:?}\", result);\n\n    let result = adapter.get_ip_address();\n    info!(\"IP {:?}\", result);\n\n    let network = adapter.into_network_stack();\n    info!(\"network intialized\");\n\n    let socket = network.open(Mode::Blocking).unwrap();\n    info!(\"socket {:?}\", socket);\n\n    let socket_addr = SocketAddr::new(\n        IpAddr::from_str(\"192.168.1.245\").unwrap(),\n        80,\n    );\n\n    let mut socket = network.connect(socket, socket_addr).unwrap();\n\n    info!(\"socket connected {:?}\", result);\n\n    let result = network.write(&amp;mut socket, b\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nhost:192.168.1.245\\r\\n\\r\\n\").unwrap();\n\n    info!(\"sent {:?}\", result);\n\n    loop {\n        let mut buffer = [0; 128];\n        let result = network.read(&amp;mut socket, &amp;mut buffer);\n        match result {\n            Ok(len) =&gt; {\n                if len &gt; 0 {\n                    let s = core::str::from_utf8(&amp;buffer[0..len]);\n                    match s {\n                        Ok(s) =&gt; {\n                            info!(\"recv: {} \", s);\n                        }\n                        Err(_) =&gt; {\n                            info!(\"recv: {} bytes (not utf8)\", len);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            Err(e) =&gt; {\n                info!(\"ERR: {:?}\", e);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nDig into the Implementation\nWe won't walk through all the bits, but to start, our NetworkStack is a simple struct, simply\nholding a RefCell of the previously \"consumed\" adapter:\npub struct NetworkStack&lt;'a, Tx&gt;\nwhere\n    Tx: Write&lt;u8&gt;,\n{\n    adapter: RefCell&lt;Adapter&lt;'a, Tx&gt;&gt;,\n}\n\nSince the TcpStack trait requires us to define our own TcpSocket type, here's ours:\n/// Handle to a socket.\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct TcpSocket {\n    link_id: usize,\n    mode: Mode,\n}\n\nThe ESP8266 supports 5 concurrent connections, identified by a link_id, which we use to index into an array.\nWe've also defined our own SocketError error type:\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub enum SocketError {\n    NoAvailableSockets,\n    SocketNotOpen,\n    UnableToOpen,\n    WriteError,\n    ReadError,\n}\n\nAnd here's where we use our TcpSocket and SocketError and get into the interior mutability:\nimpl&lt;'a, Tx&gt; TcpStack for NetworkStack&lt;'a, Tx&gt;\nwhere\n    Tx: Write&lt;u8&gt;,\n{\n    type TcpSocket = TcpSocket;\n    type Error = SocketError;\n\n    fn open(&amp;self, mode: Mode) -&gt; Result&lt;Self::TcpSocket, Self::Error&gt; {\n        let mut adapter = self.adapter.borrow_mut();\n        Ok(TcpSocket {\n            link_id: adapter.open()?,\n            mode,\n        })\n    }\n\nWhile open(...) takes an immutable self, we can borrow_mut() the adapter we're holding. \nWe can then ask the adapter to open a socket for us (or it fails if all 5 are currently in-use)\nand we return our TcpSocket structure with the recently-opened link_id.\nSummary\nThere's a lot going on to simply open a socket, but when you do embedded, you have to bring a lot\nto the table, and like an onion (or a parfait), there's layers upon layers, and thankfully as you\nmove up the stack, they get simpler and more reusable.\nAnyhow, if this seems interesting, here're some links:\n\ndrogue-network crate\ndrogue-esp8266 crate\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/wifi-offload/","title":"WiFi Offloading"},"https://blog.drogue.io/yak-hole-of-tls/":{"body":"We've recently gotten TLS functional for embedded systems in Rust. \nTLS (Transport Layer Security) is one of the backbones to secure communications over TCP/IP, helping protect data in-flight between two parties.\nThere's a lot of moving parts involved in bringing easy-to-use functional cryptography to small 32-bit ARM Cortex-M devices. \nLet's dive in, shall we?\nBetween Rust and TLS, there are a lot of yaks to shave\nWarning: This will be a long and winding blogpost. Grab a cup of coffee.\nNever write a crypto library\nOne of the primary rules in cryptography is never write your own cryptography.\nThere's a lot of smart people already writing crypto libraries, and also a lot of smart people who are happy to poke holes in your hand-rolled crypto.\nThankfully, ARM has created mbedTLS and donated it to TrustedFirmware.org.\nThat sounds perfect, yeah?\nThe downside of mbedTLS is that it's written in C, and is able to target not only embedded platforms, but also fully POSIX-compliance large host systems,\nwhich means it is highly configurable and not immediately useful to Rust developers.\nRust, C, and FFI\nRust does provide mechanisms for calling into libraries written in C. \nThey are inherently unsafe because Rust, rightly, can't trust a library written in C to understand things like lifetimes and Rust's own memory model.\nSo normally, you find yourself with a -sys crate that simply builds the C library, and then wrap that with a Rust crate that provides better safety and semantics.\nThen there's issues such as \"Rust strings are valid UTF-8 and know their length\" and \"C strings are a sequence of bytes followed by a null\", which complicates matters.\nThe drogue-tls-sys crate\nThe first order of business is simply building the mbedTLS library, appropriately configured for an ARM Cortex-M embedded device which lacks things like filesystems, a real-time clock or printf().\nEverything configurable with mbedTLS is done through a config.h file they ship, defining or undefining a variety of macros which indicate what facilities your platform supports.\nBy telling mbedTLS that our platform doesn't support traditional things like calloc(..)/free(...) or snprintf(...),  mbedTLS gives us a way to register function-pointers to those types of things for our platform.  C function pointers.\nLet's look at calloc(...)\nOnce we configure it, mbedTLS gives us this function:\nint mbedtls_platform_set_calloc_free( void * (*calloc_func)( size_t, size_t ),\n                                      void (*free_func)( void * ) );\n\nThis allows us to register functions that behave as calloc(...) and free(...), allocating and freeing memory on the heap.\nBy default, embedded Rust doesn't have a heap.\nYou can install an allocator to give you a heap, but then you also have to install an allocation error handler, which unfortunately is an unstable nightly-only feature of Rust.\nHow do we solve this?\nWe fork alloc-cortex-m, and a bit of the Rust alloc crates into our tree.\nThe only reason we have to fork them is because using them directly triggers rustc into being convinced we have a global allocator and need to install the allocation error handler, which as noted above, is nightly-only.\nAllocation in Rust\nRust does allocation using a Layout which basically embodies the size of memory you request, along with adjustments for accomodate memory alignment for your platform.\nRust also wants the exact same layout passed in when you deallocate memory, unlike C's free(...) which only needs a pointer to the memory, because it put the layout information in a header of the initial allocation.\nHow do we solve that? The same way C does, by not expecting the caller to track the layout information, but by scribbling it into the start of the allocation ourselves, also.\nIf mbedTLS needs 16 bytes allocated, it'll call calloc(1, 16) to ask for 1 chunk of 16 bytes.\nTo that, we add 8 bytes for our book-keeping header, so the allocation will ultimately become 24 bytes. The extra 8 bytes track 2 usize slots for our book-keeping: 1 for the size of the allocation (24 bytes total) and one for the alignment requirements. Since our header takes the first 8 bytes, we return the pointer to the 9th byte, which starts the chunk of 16 bytes requested by the caller of calloc(...).\nbyte |0   |1   |2   |3   |4   |5   |6   |7   |8+\n     |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------------------\n use |alloc_size         |alignment          |handed back to caller  \n\nWhen free(...) is called with only a pointer from C code, we back-track 8 bytes, read out the size and alignment values and rebuild our Layout to shuffle on into Rust's allocator's dealloc(...) method.\nThis allows us to avoid any external book-keeping, and just tacking an extra 8 bytes onto the head of each allocation.\nBindgen\nSo far we've glossed over how we actually interface from Rust to C and back.\nThe answer is bindgen, which consumes C header files and produces unsafe Rust bindings to the API. \nSince Rust has no concept of null, but C pointers can certainly be null, each pointer tends to get wrapped in a Option on the Rust side.\nWe can use the extern \"C\" syntax to write a function in Rust that can be called from C with the appropriate calling conventions. \nextern \"C\" fn platform_calloc_f(count: usize, size: usize) -&gt; *mut c_void {\n  // do the Layout and allocation dance described above\n}\n\nBindgen's processing of mbedTLS also provides us a Rust-callable function platform_set_calloc_free(...) exposed by mbedTLS. \nThis is where we finally wire stuff up.\nBut, it's an unsafe function that takes function pointers as arguments, so we have to wrap the invocation of it in an unsafe { ... } block, and wrap our functions in an Option::Some(...):\nunsafe { platform_set_calloc_free(Some(platform_calloc_f), Some(platform_free_f)) };\n\nAnd now we've finally provided mbedTLS the ability to allocate and deallocate some heap-ish memory.\nVariadics\nWhen working with TLS and doing FFI in general, you need to be able to debug what's actually going on, particular in the two weeks you're banging your head on the table trying to figure out how it all works.\nJust like calloc(...) above, mbedTLS allows you to pass in a debug logging function. \nThe problem is that the things the debug logging function prints tend to be constructed using variants of sprintf(...), which is a variadic function, meaning it can take an unlimited number of arguments to populate the formatting string.\nFor instance:\nprintf(\"%s says %s %d times\", bob_str, hi_str, 42);\n\nWould print out \"Bob says Hi 42 times\".\nStable Rust does not support variadics.\nIn our case, the two important methods are snprintf(...) which is a true variadic function, and vsnprintf(...) which is slightly less variadic, in that there's an argument that points to the remainder argument list.\nIt's trivial to write an implementation of snprintf(...) in C that delegates to vsnprintf(...) which can then be implemented, non-variadically, in Rust.\nextern int snprintf(char * restrict str, size_t size, const char * restrict fmt, ...) {\n    va_list ap;\n    int n;\n\n    va_start(ap,fmt);\n    n=vsnprintf(str,size,fmt,ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    return n;\n}\n\nThe va_start(...) macro ultimately populates the ap variable with a pointer to the arguments. \nThe arguments are really viewed as an opaque blob of memory, so you must analyze the printf formatting string to know how to treat the bytes behind that pointer.\nWe've create the drogue-ffi-compat crate to help deal with that memory interpretation.\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn vsnprintf(\n    str: *mut u8,\n    size: usize,\n    format: *const u8,\n    ap: va_list,\n) -&gt; i32 {\n    let mut va_list = VaList::from(ap);\n    // use the Rust VaList now\n}\n\nNow, if you process the printf formatting string and see a %d you know the next argument is an i32 in Rust:\nlet value: i32 = va_list.va_arg::&lt;i32&gt;();\n\nIf it's followed by a %c you know you can safely interpret the following argument as a character:\nlet value: char = va_list.va_arg::&lt;char&gt;();\n\nOf course, things will go woefully wrong if you don't have a printf formatting string to guide you through walking the va_list values.\nThe drogue-ffi-compat crate thankfully includes Just Enough printf formatting string processing to debug mbedTLS.\nJust like registering our calloc() and free() implementation with mbedTLS, we can now register our snprintf() and vsnprintf() implementations the same way, using similar functions (not pictured, because yeesh, this is getting long).\nThe drogue-tls crate\nThe drogue-tls crate handily wraps up all the machinations above into a safe and more semantic API for dealing with TLS.\nIt provides an associated function to initialize the system and it sets up the debug logging, etc, and then provides a TcpStack for doing network operations.\nThat's a lot of yaks. Let's TLS.\nRemember, we're doing this so we can put TLS on top of our TCP/IP connections.\nIf you recall from a previous blogpost, we have created a TCP stack based on using an ESP8266 over our USART. \nWe're still doing that. \nBut now we'll initialize the TLS platform and wrap it around that network stack to give us a secure network stack.\nFirst, we initialize, providing a 48kb blob of memory for the heap-ish allocation.\nWe also set up a (terrible) entropy source (this needs to be improved) and see the random-number-generator (RNG):\nlet mut ssl_platform = SslPlatform::setup(\n    cortex_m_rt::heap_start() as usize,\n    1024 * 48).unwrap();\n\nssl_platform.entropy_context_mut().add_source(StaticEntropySource);\n\nssl_platform.seed_rng().unwrap();\n\nOnce our previously-described underlying network stack is fired up and ready to rock, we can borrow it and build ourselves a secure network stack:\nlet mut ssl_config = ssl_platform.new_client_config(Transport::Stream, Preset::Default).unwrap();\nssl_config.authmode(Verify::None);\n\n// consume the config, take a non-mutable ref to the network.\nlet secure_network = SslTcpStack::new(ssl_config, &amp;network);\n\nNote, we haven't enabled verification of authentication on the far end. Normally we would have some root Certificate Authority (CA) keys set up and ensure the far end of the connection is who we think it is.\nWe're skipping that this week.\nOur secure_network also implements TcpStack so we can use it exactly as we used our non-secure stack:\nlet socket = secure_network.open(Mode::Blocking).unwrap();\n\nlet socket_addr = SocketAddr::new(\n    IpAddr::from_str(\"192.168.1.220\").unwrap(),\n    8080,\n);\n\nlet mut socket = secure_network.connect(socket, socket_addr).unwrap();\nlet result = secure_network.write(&amp;mut socket, b\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nhost:192.168.1.220\\r\\n\\r\\n\").unwrap();\n\nAnd we're secure (roughly) in knowledge that our bytes to and from the far end are travelling over an encrypted connection.\nThat was fun, yeah?\nNext Steps\n\nBetter entropy sources\nCertificate handling and validation for both sides of the conversation.\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/yak-hole-of-tls/","title":"Down the Yak Hole of TLS"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.drogue.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.drogue.io/all-things-rust/":{"body":955,"title":5},"https://blog.drogue.io/bluetooth-mesh/":{"body":1362,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/coming-up-gsoc-2021/":{"body":468,"title":6},"https://blog.drogue.io/command-your-devices/":{"body":827,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/consume-drogue-messages/":{"body":683,"title":5},"https://blog.drogue.io/digital-twins/":{"body":853,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/drg-guided-tour/":{"body":525,"title":6},"https://blog.drogue.io/drg-trust/":{"body":922,"title":8},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-eight/":{"body":741,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-eleven/":{"body":617,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-five/":{"body":425,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-four/":{"body":622,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-nine/":{"body":1034,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-seven/":{"body":493,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-six/":{"body":828,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-cloud-zero-ten/":{"body":632,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-rebase/":{"body":1152,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-to-cloud/":{"body":1058,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/drogue-device-wasm/":{"body":619,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/esp-programmer/":{"body":493,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/eswifi/":{"body":607,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-1/":{"body":1648,"title":5},"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-2/":{"body":1206,"title":6},"https://blog.drogue.io/firmware-updates-part-3/":{"body":897,"title":7},"https://blog.drogue.io/first-steps-in-iot/":{"body":661,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/hey-rodney/":{"body":757,"title":5},"https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-device/":{"body":2340,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-server/":{"body":712,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/lorawan-update/":{"body":735,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/matter-of-time/":{"body":711,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/meet-rodney/":{"body":87,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/minikube-roundtrip/":{"body":407,"title":6},"https://blog.drogue.io/more-async-and-pwm/":{"body":667,"title":6},"https://blog.drogue.io/mpu-6050/":{"body":568,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/nom-parser/":{"body":770,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/pcb-part-1/":{"body":1086,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/pcb-part-2/":{"body":715,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/quarkus-func-payload-mapper/":{"body":940,"title":5},"https://blog.drogue.io/release-030/":{"body":452,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-async/":{"body":793,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-lora/":{"body":738,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-microbit/":{"body":792,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-embedded-layer-cake/":{"body":736,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/secure-device-to-cloud/":{"body":745,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/the-book-workshops/":{"body":187,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/the-cloud-side-of-things/":{"body":568,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/websocket-integration/":{"body":381,"title":8},"https://blog.drogue.io/wifi-offload/":{"body":1144,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/yak-hole-of-tls/":{"body":1027,"title":4}},"length":50},"lang":"English"};
